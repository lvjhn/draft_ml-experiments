            "Once restored, according to the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, the Laguindab Torogan can be declared as a National Cultural Treasure like the Kawayan torogan of Marantao.",
            "A group of people are planning to nominate the torogans of Lanao del Sur to the UNESCO World Heritage List, but the nomination is being halted as of the moment due to the lack of restoration in some torogans in the area, specifically in Ganassi.",
            "The possible nomination of the Laguindab torogan to the National Cultural Treasure list and the UNESCO list is seen to boost the tourism of the area, if the torogan is conserved properly and evaluated by the local government of Ganassi, with aid request from the National Museum or National Commission for Culture and the Arts."

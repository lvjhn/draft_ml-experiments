            "Long before the Spanish colonizers landed on the Philippine shores, there were already natives living in this place.",
            "These people live in huts built on the hillsides located at the northern and eastern parts of the valley.",
            "This was so because the present valley was then the course of the Bakun River.",
            "For many years, the natives lived simply but peacefully but were soon disturbed by an unusual and fearful occurrence in the area.",
            "It all started with the continuous heavy downpour or \u201clemlem\u201d in the native dialect.",
            "This \u201clemlem\u201d caused the Bakun River to swell to an extraordinary size and overflow its banks.",
            "In the middle part of the river, there was a big \u201calicono\u201d or whirlpool which the people feared so much.",
            "Even after the rains ceased, the \u2018alicono\u2019 remained; so the people believed it to their god Kabunian's punishment for their sins.",
            "As it was their custom, the people held the native feast called \u201ckaniaw\u201d, the \u201calicono\u201d vanished and the Bakun River changed its course to the foot of the mountains in the southern part leaving a dry level land suited for residential lots and farms.",
            "The people moved their homes to the valley and named the place Alilem after the \u201calicono\u201d and \u201clemlem\u201d."

            "What is certainly known only is that the lay-out of the town was done by the Spaniards.",
            "During the Spanish occupation, Alilem was noted for being the center of the district government of \u201ccommandancia politico-militar\u201d of Amburayan.",

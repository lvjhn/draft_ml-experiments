            "Tuburan opposed such partition but when the law was upheld, it humbly gave way and followed the mandate of the law to avoid economic repercussions.",
            "Hence, being formally established as a full-fledged Municipality in 1953, makes Tabuelan, the newest and youngest municipality in Cebu Island."

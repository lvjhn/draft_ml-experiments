            "Because of the distances, travelers starting from either of these towns in the early morning were sure to be overtaken by nightfall before reaching the next place; hence the name \"guinduluman\"."
        ],
        [
            "Folklore further says that the early condition of the area itself had something to contribute to the appropriateness of the term because the center of the town was once surrounded and almost entirely shaded by a dense forest which also made the town dark even during daytime.",
            "Travelers from other places passing through this thick forest could observe its surrounding darkness because the sunlight could hardly penetrate through the thick foliage, thus causing darkness in the area at any time of the day.",
            "Such actual condition of the particular place, therefore, gave added significance to the created name."

            "The Guerillas suffered injuries but were able to flee and successfully brought their objective back to their camp in the highlands.",
            "The Japanese troops gave no chase as they were not familiar with the terrain and the anticipation of a diversionary attack by the guerillas meant that leaving post would jeopardize the garrison defenses.",

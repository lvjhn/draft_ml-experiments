Abra, officially the Province of Abra (Ilocano: Probinsia ti Abra; Tagalog: Lalawigan ng Abra), is a province in the Cordillera Administrative Region of the Philippines..Its capital is the municipality of Bangued..It is bordered by Ilocos Norte on the northwest, Apayao on the northeast, Kalinga on the mid-east, Mountain Province on the southeast, and Ilocos Sur on the southwest.
Etymology
Abra is from the Spanish word abra meaning gorge, pass, breach or opening..It was first used by the Spaniards to denote the region above the Banaoang Gap where the Abra River exits into the West Philippine Sea, thus the Rio Grande de Abra.
History
This section needs expansion..You can help by adding to it..(December 2015)
Early history
The first inhabitants of Abra were the ancestors of the Bontocs and the Ifugaos..These inhabitants eventually left to settle in the old Mountain Province..Other early inhabitants were the Tinguians or Itnegs.
Spanish colonial era
In 1585, the Tinguians were mentioned for the first time in a letter from Father Domingo de Salazar to the King of Spain.
In 1598 Bangued was occupied by Spanish-Iloco forces..The Spanish established a garrison to protect their missionaries from head hunters so that they could Christianize the Tinguians and locate gold mines..This led to the Ilocano settlement of this area.
Bangued was under the care of the Spanish missions in Vigan and Bantay..Fr..Esteban Marin and Fr..Agustin Minon established a mission in Bangued as early as 1598..On April 5, 1612, Fr..Pedro Columbo became the first minister..It would seem that this actuation of the Augustinians was precipitated by the Dominican take-over of the ministry of Narvacan since the Dominicans wanted to convert Narvacan into a mission center to evangelize the other parts of Abra..To check this Dominican move, the Augustinians elevated Bangued to a ministry.
Fr..Juan Pareja OSA, a former parish priest in Bantay, led the conversion of the province..He came to Abra in 1626 and is reported to have converted as many as 3,000 inhabitants including the chieftain Miguel Dumaoal..He founded the mission of San Diego and later the ministry of Bangued..He established the following towns as visitas of Bangued: Tayum, Sabangan and Bucao (now Dolores)..Inspired by Fr..Pareja these towns battled almost daily against the rancherias of Palang, Talamuy, Bataan, Cabulao, Calaoag, and Langiden.
Fr..Jose Polanco OP also contributed to the conversion of Abra..A man of austere mortification, he died in Abra in 1679 and was considered a saint by the locals.
Fr..Bernardino Lago OSA arrived in the early 19th century..In 1823, Fr..Lago began work in Pidigan..After 25 years the Christians were numbered about a thousand ""baptized, living in community, with schools, church and municipal house, tilling the earth to support themselves and their children."".Fr..Lago also founded the town of La Paz..Fr..Galende enumerates the foundation of the other towns of Abra:
Tayum, 1803
San Gregorio, 1829
Pidigan, 1823
La Paz, 1832
Bucay, 1847
San Jose, 1848
Villavieja, 1862
San Quintin, 1868
Dolores, 1882
Pilar, 1882
San Juan, 1884
Alfonso XII, 1884
Originally the area was called El Abra de Vigan (""The Opening of Vigan"")..During the British Occupation of the Philippines, Gabriela Silang and her army fled to Abra from Ilocos and continued the revolt begun by her slain husband Diego Silang..She was captured and hanged by authorities in 1763.
In 1818, the Ilocos region was divided into Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur..On October 9, 1846, Abra became an independent province with the capital and residence of the provincial governor located in Bucay..In 1863 the capital was transferred to Bangued, the province's oldest town..It remained so until the arrival of the Americans in 1899.
American invasion era
In 1908, the Philippine Commission annexed Abra into Ilocos Sur in an attempt to resolve Abra's financial difficulties..On March 9, 1917 the Philippine Assembly re-established Abra as a province under Act 2683.
Japanese occupation era
In 1942 Japanese forces occupied the Philippines and seized Abra.
Abra was liberated by the Filipino soldiers and guerrillas including Allied forces liberated the province of Abra in 1945 at the end of the Second World War.

Under the Marcos dictatorship
Main articles: Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos, Human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship, and Deforestation in the Philippines during the Marcos dictatorship
The beginning months of the 1970s marked a period of turmoil and change in the Philippines, as well as in Abra.
With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years.
On May 6, 1983, Sitio Beew in the Municipality of Tubo was the site of several attacks by the 623rd Philippine Constabulary (623rd PC) led by Captain Berido, Lt. Rehaldo Lebua and Lt. Juanito Puyawan, which would collectively come to be known as the ""Beew massacre."".The 623rd PC burned down four houses and a rice granary, which still contained the remains of three villagers including an unborn baby, and  Barangay Councilman Rodolfo Labawig, pregnant mother Josefina Cayandag, and her unborn child.
Modern history
The revolutionary Marxist priest Conrado Balweg, who fought for the rights of the Cordillera tribes, began his crusade in Abra..After successfully negotiating a peace accord with Balweg's group in 1987 the Philippine government created the Cordillera Administrative Region, which includes Abra.
On July 27, 2022, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake, jolted the province..Eleven people died (at least seven of them were from Abra) and more than 600 were injured.

History
This section needs expansion..You can help by adding to it..(April 2016)
Spanish colonial era
Further information: Agusan (province)
Map of Agusan province in 1918
Prior to its creation as an independent province, Agusan, as it was once undivided, was under the jurisdiction of Surigao province during the Spanish colonial period.
American invasion era
In 1907, Agusan was separated from Surigao by the American government, creating the Agusan province.
Japanese occupation era
During World War II in 1942, the Japanese Imperial forces landed in Northern Agusan.
In 1945, Filipino soldiers of the 6th, 10th, 101st, 102nd, 103rd, 107th and 110th Infantry Divisions of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the 10th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary together with the recognized Agusan guerrilla fighter units began the liberation of Northern Agusan from Japanese forces during World War II.
During the war, a unit of the joint Philippine-American defense force were located at Manot, Talacogon, in the interior of the Agusan Valley.
Philippine independence
In 1967, Republic Act 4979 divided Agusan into two independent provinces: Agusan del Norte and Agusan del Sur.
Contemporary
On August 16, 2000, the seat of provincial government was transferred from Butuan to Cabadbaran through Republic Act 8811, although the province is yet to complete the transfer of provincial services and functions to the new capital.
The capital town of Cabadbaran became a component city by virtue of Republic Act No..9494 which sought to convert the municipality into a city..The law was ratified on July 28, 2007..However, the cityhood status was lost twice in the years 2008 and 2010 after the LCP questioned the validity of the cityhood law..The cityhood status was reaffirmed after the court finalized its ruling on February 15, 2011 which declared the cityhood law constitutional.

Agusan del Sur, officially the Province of Agusan del Sur (Cebuano: Habagatang Agusan; Butuanon: Probinsya hong Agusan del Sur; Tagalog: Timog Agusan), is a province in Caraga region, Mindanao, Philippines..Its capital is the municipality of Prosperidad..It is bordered on the northwest by Agusan del Norte and Misamis Oriental; east by Surigao del Sur; southeast by Davao Oriental; mid-south by Davao de Oro; southwest by Davao del Norte and, mid-west by Bukidnon..It is the fourth largest province in the country in terms of area, with the size of 3,856 sq miles.
Etymology
Agusan derives its name from the Agusan word agasan, meaning ""where the water flows"", referring to the Agusan River that splits the land and meanders south to north in a 250-kilometre (160 mi) rush to Butuan Bay..It is third largest river in the country and served as highway for the Spanish colonizers in gaining access to inner northeastern Mindanao.
History
The Agusan image statue (900–950 CE) discovered in 1917 on the banks of the Wawa River near Esperanza, Agusan del Sur, Mindanao in the Philippines.
Early history
The history of Agusan del Sur is essentially linked with that of its sister province, Agusan del Norte.
Agusans pre-Hispanic cultural history is traced back to the great influence of the Majapahit Empire through the discovery of an 8-inch (200 mm) tall image of a woman in pure gold at Maasam, Esperanza in 1917 and molten jars unearthed at Bah-bah, Prosperidad..The aborigines of Agusan del Sur are the ancestors of the present day Mamanwas, who were driven to the hinterlands by waves of Malay immigrants..These immigrants, in turn, sought the protection of the interior jungles because of the forays and the constant raids of the Moros, who were seafaring people confined to coastal areas where they started their settlements.
Spanish colonial era
The Augustinian Recollects established a mission in Linao, in the vicinity of present-day Bunawan, in 1614..However, mission work was hampered by the hostility of the surrounding Manobo tribes..At the height of the power of the Sultanate of Maguindanao in the mid-17th century, the Manobos of the Agusan Valley were in alliance with Sultan Kudarat..Linao was attacked several times during the 1629 Caraga Revolt and the 1649 Sumuroy Revolt..Nevertheless, the Recollects were able to establish themselves in their mission work, and remained there until the middle of the 19th century.
In the late 19th century, the Recollects (under protest) turned over many of their mission territories, including those in the upper Agusan region, to the reconstituted Jesuit order (the Jesuits had been banned by Papal edict in the 1760s, and ejected from the Philippines in 1768)..Missionary work was interrupted by the Philippine Revolution when the Jesuits either fled or were arrested by revolutionaries.
The territory of Agusan del Sur was governed as part of the province of Caraga during most of the Spanish period..In 1860, it was placed under the comandancia of Butuan, a district of the province of Surigao..Bienvenido Ronquillo Blanco, Former Deputy Leader of Gibung District of Agusan was named several place of Agusan.
American invasion era
During the American occupation, lumbering became an important activity in Agusan del Sur..Visayan migrants settled in the cleared plains, pushing Indigenous communities farther into the mountainous slopes.
In 1914, the province of Agusan was created by the American government.
The Agusan Valley was settled by a variety of cultural communities like the Manobos, Mamanwas and Higaonons..Archeological excavations in the lower Agusan valley plains have uncovered evidence of strong relationships between the region and the Southeast Asian states..A golden image of Javan-Indian design unearthed in the 1920s and molten jars uncovered in Prosperidad are indications that the region had commercial and cultural ties with the coast.
Japanese occupation era
In the Second World War, Japanese troops landed in the province of Agusan in 1942 and occupied the province until their defeat by combined U.S. and Philippine Commonwealth troops as well as recognized guerrilla units in 1945 at the Battle of Agusan.
The general headquarters and military camp and base of the Philippine Commonwealth Army was active from January 3, 1942, to June 30, 1946, and the 10th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was active again from October 28, 1944, to June 30, 1946, are military stationed in the province of Surigao was composed to engaging operations against the Japanese Occupation.
In 1945, Filipino soldiers of the 6th, 10th, 101st, 102nd, 103rd, 107th and 110th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the 10th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary together with the recognized Agusan guerrilla fighter units against the Japanese forces began the liberation in Northern Agusan during World War II.
During World War II, a unit of the joint Philippine-American defense force was located at Manot, Talacogon, in the interior of the Agusan Valley.
Philippine independence
The province of Agusan del Sur was established on June 17, 1967, under Republic Act No..4969 providing for the division of the province of Agusan into Agusan del Norte and Agusan del Sur.
In January 1970, the first set of provincial officials assumed office after the provincial election of November, 1969..The same law provided that the capital of Agusan del Sur be the municipality of Prosperidad..The Government Center has been set up in Barangay Patin-ay.
Contemporary
The municipality of Bayugan became a component city by virtue of Republic Act No..9405 which sought to convert the municipality into a city..The law was ratified on June 21, 2007..However, the cityhood status was lost twice in the years 2008 and 2010 after the LCP questioned the validity of the cityhood law..The cityhood status was reaffirmed after the court finalized its ruling on February 15, 2011 which declared the cityhood law constitutional.
Geography
Land area
In 1976, the province's land area was 8,568 square kilometres (3,308 sq mi), making it the seventh largest province in the country..After claiming the disputed boundary between Davao del Norte, Butuan and with the creation of Sibagat, Agusan del Sur now has an area of 8,966 square kilometres (3,462 sq mi).
The municipalities of Loreto, La Paz, Esperanza, and San Luis are the four largest municipalities in land area comprising almost 60% of the province's total land area..Santa Josefa and Talacogon, also river towns, have the smallest land area.
Forestland constitutes 76% of the total land area or 6,827.5 square kilometres (2,636.1 sq mi) while the alienable and disposable constitutes about 24% or 2,137.5 square kilometres (825.3 sq mi)..Present land use, however, showed that settlements and commercial areas already occupy some of the forestlands.
Through the years, the province has lost much of its forest resources because existing industries are extractive in nature.
Topography
Agusan del Sur is an elongated basin formation with mountain ranges in the eastern and western sides forming a valley, which occupies the central longitudinal section of the land..The Agusan River, which flows from Davao de Oro in the south towards Agusan del Norte in the north, runs almost in the middle of the valley and empties at Butuan Bay..The river has twelve tributaries: Wawa, Gibong and Simulao Rivers in the eastern side and Ojot, Pusilao, Kasilayan, Libang, Maasam, Adgawan, Cawayan, Umayam and Ihaon Rivers in the western side..These tributaries are fed by streams and creeks..The southern half of the province from the municipality of Veruela is an area filled with swamps and lakes, the biggest of which is Talacogon Lake.
Climate
The climate map of the Philippines based on the modified coronas classification shows that the province falls under Type II.
Type II climate has no dry season with very pronounced wet season of heavy precipitation..Maximum rainfall generally occurs from December to January although there is no single dry month..Its average monthly rainfall is 355 millimetres (14.0 in) and average temperature is 27.15 °C (80.87 °F)..Areas characterized by this climate type are generally along or very near the eastern coast thus are open to the northeast monsoon.
Agusan del Sur is among the 20 most vulnerable provinces to climate change in the Philippines.
Administrative divisions
Agusan del Sur comprises 13 municipalities and 1 city..There are 314 barangays.

Early history
Aklan is believed to have been settled in the 13th century by settlers from Borneo, ruled by the chieftain Datu Dinagandan which traded with its neighbouring islands..Aklan then became a part of the Kedatuan of Madja-as..Towards the end of the 13th century, Datu Dinagandan moved the capital from what is now Batan.
In 1433, Datu Kalantiaw's grandson and successor, Datu Kalantiaw III, was said by Jose Marcos to have formulated a set of laws known today as the Code of Kalantiaw..Well-respected scholarly long-term Philippine resident historian William Henry Scott proved these ""laws"" to be a total fabrication.
In 1437, the short-lived dynasty of Datu Kalantiaw ended when Datu Kalantiaw III was killed in battle with the tribes of Datu Manduyog, the legitimate successor of Datu Dinagandan..When Datu Manduyog became the new chieftain, he moved the capital to Bakan (now known as Banga).
Spanish colonial era
Several datus succeeded Datu Manduyog until the Spanish explorer Miguel López de Legazpi landed in Batan in 1565 and claimed the island for Spain, in early Spanish accounts it was called El Río de Aclán..Datu Kabanyag was the chieftain at that period and had his capital in Libacao.
Japanese occupation era
In 1942, the Japanese invaded Aklan during World War II..In 1945, combined Filipino and American army along with Aklanon guerrillas liberated Aklan during the war in the Pacific.

Two main dishes associated with Aklan and Aklanons are inubaran
Inubaran, is a Filipino chicken stew or soup made with chicken cooked with diced banana pith, coconut milk (gata) or coconut cream (kakang gata), a souring agent, lemongrass, and various spices..The souring agent (called aeabihig) is traditionally either batuan fruits (Garcinia morella) or libas leaves (Spondias pinnata)..The name means ""
Binakol, also spelled binakoe, is a Filipino chicken soup made from chicken cooked in coconut water with grated coconut, green papaya (or chayote), leafy vegetables, garlic, onion, ginger, lemongrass, and patis (fish sauce)..It can also be spiced with chilis..Binakol can also be cooked with other kinds of meat or seafood..It was traditionally cooked inside bamboo tubes or directly on halved coconut shells.
Linapay also known as tinamuk, is a dish related to Laing but from Aklan in the Western Visayas..It is made from pounded freshwater shrimp (ueang) mixed with gawud (grated young coconut meat) and wrapped with taro leaves (gutaw) and cooked in coconut milk.
Festivals
The province is known for its festivities which includes the Ati-Atihan festival in Kalibo..Originally, the festival was to celebrate the treaty between the Ati and the Malayan tribes who settled in the Island..The Ati live in the mountain regions and the Malay people in the flatlands or close to the water..The festivity begins on the dry season, at which time the Ati come down from the mountains to trade and celebrate with the Malayan tribes..When the Spaniards settled in the region and converted the Malays to their Christian religion, they asked the Malays to celebrate this festivity to coincide with the Feast of the Santo Niño (Holy Child) which is usually held during the third week of January.
Bariw Festival is a unique festival showcasing the skills of every Nabasnon in weaving bags, mats and hats made of bariw leaves – the prospering livelihood in the municipality..It is highlighted by the dance performance of local talent and ingenuity to the beat of the drums and indigenous rhythm celebrated every May 14 of the year.

Literature
Aklanons are known for their literature, which includes the epic of Kalantiao..Certain Aklanons, such as Melchor F. Cichon, Roman Aguirre, have produced several notable literary works in the province.
Ati – Atihan Festival
Participants in the Ati-Atihan Festival parade
The Ati-Atihan Festival is a feast held annually in honor of the Santo Niño (Infant Jesus), held on the third Sunday of January in the town of Kalibo, Aklan, Philippines, on the island of Panay..It originally came from Batan, Aklan, then adopted later by some neighboring towns..The name Ati-Atihan means ""to be like Atis"" or ""to make believe Atis"", the local name for the Aeta aborigines who first settled in Panay Island and other parts of the archipelago.
The festival consists of tribal dance, music, accompanied by indigenous costumes and weapons, and parade along the street..Christians and non-Christians observe this day with religious processions..It has inspired many other Philippine Festivals including the Sinulog Festival of Cebu and Dinagyang of Iloilo City, both adaptations of the Kalibo's Ati-Atihan Festival, and legally holds the title ""The Mother of All Philippine Festivals"", being the oldest festival in the Philippines and in spite of the other Sinulog and Dinagyang festivals' claims of the same title.
The costumes worn at the festival is patterned after the African tribal design like those seen at the Rio Carnival in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
A 1200 A.D. event explains the origins of the festival..A group of 10 Malay chieftains called Datus, fleeing from the island of Borneo settled in the Philippines, and were granted settlement by the Ati people, the tribes of Panay Island..Datu Puti made a trade with the natives and bought the plains for a golden salakot, brass basins and bales of cloth..They gave a very long necklace to the wife of the Ati chieftain..Feasting and festivities followed soon after.
Some time later, the Ati people were struggling with famine as the result of a bad harvest..They were forced to descend from their mountain village into the settlement below, to seek the generosity of the people who now lived there..The Datus obliged and gave them food..In return, the Ati danced and sang for them, grateful for the gifts they had been given.
The festivity was originally a pagan festival from this tribe practicing Animism, and their worshiping their anito god..Spanish missionaries gradually added a Christian meaning..Today, the Ati-Atihan is celebrated as a religious festival.
In 2012, the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) and the ICHCAP of UNESCO published Pinagmulan: Enumeration from the Philippine Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage..The first edition of the UNESCO-backed book included the Ati-atihan Festival, signifying its great importance to Philippine intangible cultural heritage..The local government of Aklan, in cooperation with the NCCA, was given the right to nominate the Ati-atihan Festival in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.
The people attend masses for the Santo Niño, and benefit dances sponsored by government organizations..The formal opening mass emphasizes the festival's religious event..The procession begins with a rhythmic drumbeats, and dances parading along the streets..The second day begins at dawn with a rosary procession, which ends with a community mass, and procession..The phrase ""Hala Bira!.Pwera Pasma!"".is originally associated with the Sto..Nino Ati-Atihan Festival as the revelers and devotees keep on going with the festivities all over the town from morning to the wee hours of the next morning, rain or shine, for one week or even more..They believe that the miraculous Child Jesus will protect them from harm and illness..The highlight of the festival occurs on the third Saturday of January, when groups representing different tribes compete for tourists' attention and prizes..The festival ends with a procession of thousands of people carrying torches and different kinds of images of the Santo Niño on the third Sunday..The contest winners are announced at a masquerade ball which officially ends the festival.

The province was added to the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves in March 2016.
History
Early history
Long before the Spaniards arrived, Albay had a thriving civilization..Formerly called Ibat, and then Libog, Albay was once ruled by Gat Ibal, an old chief who also founded the old barangay of Sawangan, now part of the City of Legazpi..Historian William Henry Scott wrote that in the local epic called siday entitled ""Bingi of Lawan"", an Albay datu by the name of Dumaraog went to the Lakanate of Lawan (present-day Laoang, Northern Samar) to ask for the hands of Bingi bringing with him 100 ships..Datu Hadi Iberein came from the Lakanate of Lawan..He was described by Scott as a “Samar datu by the name of Iberein was rowed out to a Spanish vessel anchored in his harbor in 1543 by oarsmen collared in gold; while wearing on his own person earrings and chains.”
Spanish colonial era
In July 1569, Luis Enriquez de Guzman, a member of the expedition led by Maestro de Campo Mateo de Saz and Captain Martin de Goiti, led a group that crossed from Burias and Ticao islands and landed on a coastal settlement called Ibalon in what is now the province of Sorsogon..From this point, another expedition was sent to explore the interior and founded the town of Camalig.
In 1573, Juan de Salcedo penetrated the Bicol Peninsula from the north as far south as Libon, establishing the settlement of Santiago de Libon..Jose Maria Peñaranda, a military engineer, was made “corregidor” of the province on May 14, 1834..He constructed public buildings and built roads and bridges.
The entire Bicol peninsula was organized as one province with two divisions, Camarines in the northwest and Ibalon in the southeast..In 1636, the two partidos were separated, and Ibalon became a separate province with Sorsogon as the capital..In the 17th century, Moro slave raiders from the southern Philippines ravaged the northeastern coastal areas of the province of Albay..: 31, 54, 113
Mayon Volcano, in one of its most violent eruptions, destroyed the five towns surrounding its base on February 1, 1814..This eruption forced the town of Cagsawa to relocate to its present site, Legazpi.
A decree was issued by Governor-General Narciso Claveria in 1846 separating Masbate, Ticao, and Burias from Albay to form the comandancia of Masbate..Albay was then divided into four districts: Iraya, Cordillera or Tabaco, Sorsogon, and Catanduanes.
Philippine revolution
Glicerio Delgado, a condemned insurecto (insurgent), started revolutionary activities in the province..With a headquarters in the mountain of Guinobatan town, he joined the revolutionary government of Albay as a lieutenant in the infantry.
A unit of the Philippine Militia was then organized by the Spanish military authorities..Mariano Riosa was appointed major of the Tabaco Zone, which comprised all the towns along the seacoast from Albay to Tiwi while Anacieto Solano was appointed major for the Iraya Zone, which was made up of the towns from Daraga to Libon..Each town was organized into sections of fifty men under the command of a lieutenant.
During the Philippine Revolution on September 22, 1898, the provisional revolutionary government of Albay was formed with Anacieto Solano as provisional president..Major General Vito Belarmino, the appointed military commander, reorganized the Filipino Army in the province.
American invasion era
Following the Spanish–American War, the new colonial power the United States did not recognize the country's independence, which had been declared in June 1898, and the Americans subsequently acquired direct control of the country as a de facto colony, under the terms of the Treaty of Paris (1898), over which the Filipinos had no say..During the Philippine–American War, Brigadier General William August Kobbé headed the expedition that landed at the ports of Sorsogon, Bulan and Donsol..From there, the Americans marched to Legazpi and captured it.
Although a civil government was established in Albay on April 26, 1901, Colonel Harry Hill Bandholtz, Commanding Officer of the Constabulary in the Bicol Region, said that General Simeon Ola, with a thousand men, continued to defy American authority after the capture of Belarmino in 1901..Ola was later captured with about six hundred of his men.
Japanese occupation era
Following the December 12, 1941, Japanese invasion of Legazpi during the Second World War, the Kimura Detachment of the Imperial Japanese Army occupied Albay Province..The region was defended only by the Philippine Constabulary unit under the command of Major Francisco Sandico.
During the Japanese Occupation, the military general headquarters of the Commonwealth Army of the Philippines remained active from January 3, 1942, to June 30, 1946, and the 5th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was established from October 28, 1944, to June 30, 1946, and stationed in Albay..Then came the clearing operations and anti-Japanese insurgency in the Bicol Peninsula, helped by the local Bicolano resistance..Some Bicolano guerrilla groups invaded around the province of Albay during the Japanese Insurgencies between 1942 and 1944 and were supported by local Filipino troops under the Philippine Commonwealth Army and pre-war Philippine Constabulary 5th Infantry Regiments attacking the enemy soldiers of the Japanese Imperial Army..In the aftermath of three years of siege and conflicts, many Bicolano guerrillas were forced to retreat by the Japanese around the province before liberation in 1945 by Allied forces.
Geography
The Mayon Volcano dominates the geography of Albay.
Albay has a total land area of 2,575.77 square kilometres (994.51 sq mi), which makes it the 53rd biggest province..The province is bordered by the provinces of Camarines Sur to the north and Sorsogon to the south..To the northeast lies Lagonoy Gulf, which separates the province from Catanduanes..To the southwest of the province is the Burias Pass with the island of Burias of Masbate province located about 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) offshore.
In 2016, an area of 250,000 hectares (620,000 acres) was declared a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve..The Albay Biosphere Reserve is home to 182 terrestrial plant species, of which 46 are endemic to the Philippines..Its marine waters and coastal area also provide habitat to five of the world's seven marine turtle species, as well as mangrove, seagrass and seaweed ecosystems.
Topography
The province is generally mountainous with scattered fertile plains and valleys..On the eastern part of the province is a line of volcanic mountains starting with the northernmost Malinao in Tiwi, followed by Mount Masaraga and the free-standing Mayon Volcano..Separated by the Poliqui Bay is the Pocdol Mountains in the town of Manito.
The stratovolcano of Mayon standing at around 2,462 metres (8,077 ft), is the highest point of the province..It is the most famous landform in Albay and in the whole Bicol Region..This active volcano falls under the jurisdiction of eight municipalities and cities of Albay: Camalig, Daraga, Guinobatan, Legazpi City, Ligao City, Malilipot, Santo Domingo, and Tabaco City.
The western coast of the province is mountainous but not as prominent as the eastern range with the highest elevation at around 490 metres (1,610 ft)..Among these mountains are Mount Catburawan in Ligao and Mount Pantao in Oas.
Administrative divisions
Albay comprises 15 municipalities/towns and three component cities (Legazpi, Ligao and Tabaco).

Antique, officially the Province of Antique (; Kinaray-a: Kapuoran kang Antique; Hiligaynon: Kapuoran sang Antique; Tagalog: Lalawigan ng Antique), is a province in the Philippines located in the Western Visayas region..Its capital is San Jose de Buenavista, the most populous town in Antique..The province is situated in the western section of Panay Island and borders Aklan, Capiz and Iloilo to the east, while facing the Sulu Sea to the west.
The province is home to the indigenous Iraynun-Bukidnon, speakers of a dialect of the Kinaray-a language, who have crafted the only rice terrace clusters in the Visayas through indigenous knowledge and sheer vernacular capabilities..The rice terraces of the Iraynun-Bukidnon are divided into four terraced fields, namely, General Fullon rice terraces, Lublub rice terraces, Bakiang rice terraces, and San Agustin rice terraces..All of the rice terrace clusters have been researched by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts and various scholars from the University of the Philippines..There have been campaigns to nominate the Iraynun-Bukidnon Rice Terraces, along with the Central Panay Mountain Range, into the UNESCO World Heritage List.

Antique was one of the three sakups (districts) of Panay before Spanish colonizers arrived on the islands..The province was known at that time as Hantík, the local name for the large black ants found on the island..The Spanish chroniclers, influenced by the French, recorded the region's name as Hantique (with the silent 'h'), but this was only adopted in areas near Malandog River in present Hamtic town which then became the provincial capital (shortly before Bugason and San Jose)..The province bearing its former capital's name is spelled and pronounced as ""Antique"" (än-ti-ké), without 'h' and pronounced in (Kinaray-a) dialectic way.
History
Early history
See also: Kedatuan of Madja-as
Historians believe that the earliest people who settled on the island of Panay were tribal Negritos or Atis..Oral history, relayed as the ""Maragtas"", states that ten ""datus"" or minor tribal Malay chieftains escaped persecution from a city called Odtohan from Borneo due to a tyrant ruler called Makatunaw..There are claims that the narrative of the Maragtas is dated to 1212 to fit with the transition of the Srivijayan Empire to Majapahit but there are no written evidence about this, nor there are any existing claims that links the datus to Borneo..Nevertheless, the Maragtas narrative is to be considered as part of the local history of the people.
According to the Maragtas, the Bornean datus upon arrival met with the Ati chieftain Datu Marikudo and his wife Maniwantiwan..They offered the chieftain a salakot (wide-brimmed hat)
The island of Panay was then divided into three sakups: Hantik, Akean and Irong-Irong..Irong-Irong became Iloilo, Akean became the present-day Aklan and Capiz, and Hantik (also called Hamtik or Hamtic) became Antique..Hantik was named for the large black ants found on the island called ""hantik-hantik"".
Spanish colonial era
During the Spanish colonial period, the coastal province was vulnerable to attacks by Moro raiders..Under the direction of the Spanish friars, a series of watchtowers, like the 'Old Watchtower' in Libertad and Estaca Hill in Bugasong, were built to guard Antique.
In 1790, Antique was converted into a politico-military province with the town of Antique (now Hamtic) as its first capital..The provincial seat of government was later transferred to Bugasón (old name of Bugasong), and finally to San Jose de Buenavista..: 31, 54, 113
Japanese occupation era
In 1942, the Imperial Japanese Army landed in Antique and occupied the province during the Second World War.
During the Japanese Insurgencies and Occupation (1942-1944), the military general headquarters and camp bases of the 6th and 62nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army was active from January 3, 1942, to June 30, 1946, and the military general headquarters and camp bases of the 6th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was re-activated between October 28, 1944, and June 30, 1946.
Between 1944 and 1945, Philippine Commonwealth forces of the 6th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary and the 6th and 62nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army defeated the Japanese troops and liberated the province..The liberation was achieved with the active support of recognized local guerrillas.

Apayao, officially the Province of Apayao (Ilocano: Probinsia ti Apayao; Itawit: Provinsiya ya Apayao; Isnag: Provinsia nga Apayao; Tagalog: Lalawigan ng Apayao), is a landlocked province in the Philippines in the Cordillera Administrative Region in Luzon..Kabugao serves as its capital..The provincial capitol and its associated offices are located at the New Government Center in Luna.
The province borders Cagayan to the north and east, Abra and Ilocos Norte to the west, and Kalinga to the south..Prior to 1995, Kalinga and Apayao comprised a single province named Kalinga-Apayao, which was partitioned to better service the needs of individual ethnic groups.
With a population of 124,366 (as of the 2020 census) Apayao is the least densely-populated province in the Philippines, the least developed province in Luzon and one of the poorest.
History
By 20th century, Apayao is predominated by the Isneg people..They are located primarily in the highland municipalities of Kabugao and Calanasan..Majority of them live in scattered settlements along the upper reaches of the Apayao-Abulug River; while some along a major tributary of the Matalag River in Conner.
Spanish colonial era
Although Apayao which was then part of Cagayan, was among the earliest areas penetrated by the Spaniards in the Cordilleras, the region, inhabited by the Isneg tribe, remained largely outside Spanish control until late in the 19th century..As early as 1610, the Dominican friars established a mission in what is now the town of Pudtol..In 1684, the friars again made attempts to convert the people and established a church in what is now Kabugao.
Ruins of Pudtol Church, built in 1684 by the Dominicans and abandoned in 1815
The Spanish authorities were then able to establish in Cagayan the comandancias of Apayao and Cabugaoan in 1891, which covered the western and eastern portions of what is now Apayao..The comandancias, however, failed to bring total control and the Spanish government only maintained a loose hold over the area.
American invasion era
Apayao was established through Act No..1642 on May 9, 1907 as a sub-province of Cagayan province.
The Americans established the Mountain Province on August 13, 1908, with the enactment of Act No..1876..Apayao was incorporated; and along with Amburayan, Benguet, Bontoc, Ifugao, Kalinga, and Lepanto, became sub-provinces of this new province.
In the early years, the sub-province underwent series of territorial changes:
Part of Apayao was transferred to the Province of Ilocos Norte (Executive Order 21, 1920).
1922: A barrio of municipal district of Bayag (now Calanasan) was transferred to Namaltugan.
1927: Parts of the municipal district of Pinukpuk in Kalinga were annexed to Conner.
Through EO 200, approved on September 6, 1929, barrios in Tauit were organized into a separate municipal district, Luna, effective October 1.
Through EO 13, approved on January 21, 1936, Tauit was abolished and was annexed as a single barrio to Luna, effective February 1.
Through EO 78, approved on December 23, 1936, Namaltugan was abolished and was annexed to Bayag and Kabugao, effective January 1, 1937.
In the early years, Apayao as a sub-province was divided into seven municipal districts, all Isneg predominated.
While the Isneg clashed with the Philippine Constabulary in the early years, the families attempted to escape the area and go into the mountains of Ilocos Norte and Abra..They were involved in an attack in Tauit in 1913.
Japanese occupation era
This section needs expansion..You can help by adding to it..(January 2015)
In 1942, Japanese Imperial forces entered Apayao, starting a three-year occupation of the province during the Second World War.
During the Second World War, Kabugao was occupied for a year by the Japanese; an Isneg guerilla force was organized under a United States Army captain who had escaped the Fall of Bataan..Little fighting occurred in the sub-province, but a number of Isneg fought with the American and Filipino forces in the Cagayan Valley and in the neighboring areas..The war and the post-war era seen development among the Isnegs, although slowly.
Postwar Era
Kalinga-Apayao creation and splitting
Main article: Kalinga-Apayao
On June 18, 1966, the huge Mountain Province was split into four provinces with the enactment of Republic Act No..4695..The four provinces were Benguet, Bontoc (renamed ""Mountain Province""), Kalinga-Apayao and Ifugao.
During the Marcos dictatorship
The beginning months of the 1970s marked a period of turmoil and change in the Philippines, as well as in Kalinga-Apayao.
With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years.
Apayao was deeply affected by events that took place in its sister sub-province of Kalinga, as well as the neighboring provinces of Abra and Mountain Province (Bontoc, including the struggle against the Chico Dam Project, the struggle against the encroachment on indigenous lands of logging company Cellophil Resources Corporation owned by Marcos crony Herminio Disini, and the rise of multiple armed Cordilleran autonomy movements.
After the People Power Revolution
After Marcos was finally deposed by the civilian-led People Power Revolution in 1986, many of the activists who had joined the underground movement decided to ""surface,"" as the new administration of Corazon Aquino released political prisoners and initiated peace talks.
Another event in 1986 marked the beginning of political change in the region, however - the splitting of the Cordillera People's Liberation Army from the New People's Army..Former Catholic priest Conrado Balweg, who had left his calling and joined the NPA in 1979, had been having disagreements with the NPA leadership over tactics and objectives in the Cordillera for four years when he finally decided to split from the NPA in early April 1986, Either way, this set the stage for negotiations which would eventually lead to the creation of the Cordillera Administrative Region, and Apayao as an independent province within it.
Peace accord and creation of the Cordillera Administrative Region creation
Main article: Cordillera Administrative Region
In September 1986, the CPLA signed the Mount Data Peace Accord with the government, which led to the creation of what became called the Cordillera Autonomous Region, although attempts to ratify actual autonomy in the region have failed due to non-ratification during plebiscites.
The Cordillera Administrative Region was established on July 15, 1987, and Kalinga-Apayao was made one of its provinces.
Separation of Kalinga and Apayao provinces
Finally, on February 14, 1995, Kalinga-Apayao was split into two independent provinces with the passage of Republic Act No..7878.

Apayao is devoted to agricultural production, particularly food and industrial crops such as palay,
Economic activity is also based on livestock and poultry breeding such as swine, carabao, cattle, goat and sheep..Other additional investment includes manufacturing, food processing, furniture, crafts and house wares making.
Updated records of the Department of Trade and Industry Provincial Office reveal that existing industries in the province are furniture, garment craft, food processing, gifts and house wares, and agricultural support.
The people of Apayao also have a rich tradition of basket, handicraft, and textile weaving.
Tauit
Tauit (or Tawit), an Isneg settlement along the lower Apayao-Abulug River, was a former municipal district and Apayao's first sub-provincial capital (1907–1915) until the capital was moved to Kabugao in August 1915 by virtue of Executive Order No..45.
Tauit is said to be the forerunner of the present-day Pudtol.
In 1913, a band of Isneg attacked Tauit, as they were infuriated by the large number of Ilocano settling in the territory under the protection of the local government.
In 1926, Allacapan was founded as its municipal district..In July 1927, the area was separated from Tauit and was organized into an independent one with the same name by virtue of EO No..68.
In 1929, a separate municipal district taken from Tauit, Macatel (later renamed Luna through a resolution), was organized through EO No..200.
Difficulties in transportation led to the decision to abandon Tauit as a municipal district and to be represented by Luna.
Tauit was abolished through EO No..13, issued on January 21, 1936 and effective February 1, with remaining territories annexed as a single barrio to Luna.
Parts of the territories of Pudtol and Luna were later established as the municipalities of Flora and Santa Marcela; meanwhile, Tauit also comprised some parts of Lasam in Cagayan..At present, remnants of Tauit are located in northeastern Apayao and in few parts of Cagayan.

Aurora, officially the Province of Aurora (Filipino: Lalawigan ng Aurora; Ilocano: Probinsia ti Aurora), is a province in the Philippines located in the eastern part of Central Luzon region, facing the Philippine Sea..Its capital is Baler and borders, clockwise from the south, the provinces of Quezon, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino, and Isabela.
Before 1979, Aurora was part of the province of Quezon..Aurora was, in fact, named after Aurora Aragon, the wife of Manuel L. Quezon, the president of the Philippine Commonwealth, after whom the mother province was named.
History
Map of northern Tayabas in 1909.
Spanish colonial era
In 1572, the Spanish explorer Juan de Salcedo became the first European to visit the region that would be known as Aurora while he was exploring the northern coast of Luzon..Salcedo reportedly visited the towns of Casiguran, Baler and Infanta..Baler & Casiguran were part of La Provincia de La Pampanga, which also included Pampanga, Bulacan, and Tarlac, and in 1591, the towns became part of Kalilayan, which included Nueva Ecija, until Kalilayan changed its name to Tayabas in 1749, taken from the town of the same name.
In the early days of the Spanish colonial period, Aurora was ecclesiastically linked to Infanta, which today rests further south, in northern Quezon..The earliest missionaries in the province were the Franciscans, who had established missions in Baler and Casiguran in 1609..Due to lack of available personnel, the region was given to the jurisdiction of the Augustinians and Recollects in 1658, but was returned to the Friars Minor in 1703..Other early missions included Dipaculao, established in 1719, and Casiguran, in 1753.
In 1705, the Military Comandancia of Nueva Ecija was created and was governed by Governor-General Fausto Cruzat y Góngora..It included huge swathes of Central Luzon, the Contracosta towns, as well as the Kalilayan area and Polillo Islands, however Nueva Ecija was still part of La Pampanga province at that time.
In 1818, Nueva Ecija annexed the towns of Palanan from Isabela, as well as Baler, Casiguran, Infanta (formerly called Binangonan de Lampon) and Polillo Islands from Tayabas, and Cagayan, Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino, and part of Rizal.
American invasion era

An old map showing the current northern territory of Aurora as part of Nueva Vizcaya.
District of El Principe
The early history of Aurora is linked to Quezon province, of which it formed a part, and Nueva Ecija, under which the area was governed as the District of El Príncipe..In 1902, the district was separated from Nueva Ecija and transferred to the province of Tayabas (now Quezon)..In 1918, the area of modern Aurora north of Baler was transferred to the authority of Nueva Vizcaya, but returned to Tayabas in 1946, when Tayabas was renamed to Quezon..This was named in honor of Manuel Quezon who was the second President of the Philippines and elected governor of Tayabas in 1906 and congressman of 1st district of Tayabas in 1907 born and raised in Baler, formerly one of the towns of the province.
World War II
In 1942, invading Japanese forces landed in the town of Casiguran..On February 19, 1945, to May 11, 1945, Allied troops as well as Philippine Commonwealth forces and recognized guerrilla units fought on the Battle of Casiguran during the return of American forces on Luzon on World War II.
Postwar era
During the postwar years, there were several attempts to make Aurora independent from the rest of Quezon Province..One obvious reason was the area's isolation from the rest of Quezon Province: there were no direct links to the rest of the province and much of the terrain was mountainous and heavily forested, which made the area relatively isolated.
Aurora became a sub-province of Quezon in 1951 through Republic Act No..648 under the presidency of Elpidio Quirino, after whom its neighboring province was named.
In 1978, the Lieutenant Governor of the Sub-Province Atty..Luis S. Etcubañez filed a Parliamentary Bill for the establishment of Aurora at the Interim Batasang Pambansa, leveraging his political ties with the various Assemblymen of Region IV.
1968 Casiguran earthquake
On 04:19:22 local time on August 2, the 1968 Casiguran earthquake, with a moment magnitude of 7.6 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent), took place with an epicenter was in Casiguran..The quake generated a small non-destructive tsunami, but the majority of the 207 people killed during the quake were the result of the collapse of a six-story building in Manila.
During the Marcos dictatorship
Main articles: Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos and Human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship
The beginning months of the 1970s had marked a period of turmoil and change in the Philippines, as well as in Aurora..: ""43""
With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years.
One significant impact on the residents of Aurora, especially its farmers, was the administration's practice of hamletting to achieve military control of the area.
Things took a more violent turn in the town Dinalungan during the early 1980s, after farmers organized a rally against a landowner who attempted to claim their farms, seeking help and support from the nuns at the Carmelite mission which had been established there.
Birth of the Surf tourism industry
See also: Apocalypse Now
One of the positive things that did happen to Aurora during the 1970s was the development of the Surf tourism industry after the helicopter attack and surfing sequences of the film Apocalypse Now were filmed at Baler in 1976–77..The exposure of locals to the art of surfing during the production of the movie is credited with having sparked the surfing culture in Aurora and the Philippines.
Administrative assignment
Being originally part of the province of Quezon, Aurora was part of the Southern Tagalog Region (Region IV)..Upon the issuance of Executive Order No..103, dated May 17, 2002, by then-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, the province of Aurora was moved to Central Luzon (Region III), the geographical location of the province..The provinces south of Aurora were reformed as Calabarzon and Mimaropa, and Southern Tagalog was limited to being a cultural-geographic region..The total separation of Aurora from Quezon, and the transfer of Aurora to Central Luzon were the fulfillment of the wishes and prayers of the residents of the original Municipalities of Baler and Casiguran to be truly independent from Quezon Province for the first time and to reform the original La Pampanga since the Spanish occupation..The transfer of Aurora to Central Luzon opened the access of Central Luzon to Pacific Ocean.
Contemporary
On April 22, 2024, newly installed Governor Reynante A. Tolentino took his oath of office as governor before his brother, Dipaculao Mayor Danilo A. Tolentino..He replaced Atty..Christian Noveras, who was dismissed by the Office of the Ombudsman along with his father, Vice Governor Gerardo Noveras, in December, 2023.

Tagalogs, some originating from Palanan and Infanta, Quezon, came in to the area to trade by boat, some Tagalogs settled in Aurora (especially Baler) and married with the Aeta and Bugkalots..These ethnic groups who lived for several centuries & left cultural influences & legacies made Aurora the melting pot of the Central Luzon, next to Tarlac & Nueva Ecija.

Basilan, officially the Province of Basilan (Chavacano: Provincia de Basilan; Yakan: Wilayah Basilanin; Tausug: Wilaya' sin Basilan; Filipino: Lalawigan ng Basilan), is an island province of the Philippines located primarily in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region..Basilan Island is the largest and northernmost of the major islands of the Sulu Archipelago..It is just off the southern coast of the geographic Zamboanga Peninsula.
Isabela, the former capital, is a component city under the provincial government of Basilan but is administered as part of the Zamboanga Peninsula Region and is listed statistically independent..The provincial capital has since been transferred to Lamitan..Despite this, the provincial Capitol and government offices are still located at Isabela.
Basilan is home to three main ethnolinguistic groups: the indigenous Yakans, and the later-arriving Tausugs and Chavacanos..The Yakans and Tausugs are predominantly Muslim, while the Chavacano are mainly Christian..There are also a number of smaller ethnic groups..Although the official languages are Filipino and English, the main native language is Yakan and lingua franca is Chavacano..Other languages include Tausug, Cebuano, and Sama.
Basilan, although classified as a 3rd-class province in terms of gross provincial income, has one of the lowest incidences of poverty in the Philippines (26.19% of the general population), ranked 20 among the Philippines' 80 provinces..(In comparison, Maguindanao which is ranked last at number 80 has a poverty incidence of 44.24%.).The gap between Basilan's rich and poor residents are among the narrowest in the country (ranked 3rd nationwide), pointing to one of the most equitable distributions of wealth anywhere in the country (Gini coefficient 0.2826, which is slightly better than the provinces of Pampanga, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Tarlac, Cavite, Batanes and Batangas).
Etymology
Examples of finely crafted Moro blades made from Basilan ""basih"" (iron).
Antonio Pigafetta of the Magellan Expedition, records the name of Basilan as ""Taghima"", and was variously spelled in other early European maps as ""Tanguima"", ""Taglima"", ""Tagimar"", ""Tagema"", and ""Tagyto""..The first record of it being called ""Basilan"" is by a Jesuit historian, Fr..Colin.
Oral traditions of the local Yakan people include several names for pre-historic Basilan: ""Uleyan"", which is derived from the present-named Basilan Peak (Puno Mahaji), and later changed to ""Matangal"" after a mountain farther to the east of the island..These names were presumably used by the Maguindanao traders from mainland Mindanao, using these mountains as navigation landmarks when sailing the Celebes Sea.
Other names romantically given were ""Puh Gulangan"" or ""island of forests"", ""Umus Tambun"" or ""fertile land"", ""Kumalarang"" after the westward flowing river on the island's western half which is otherwise called Baunuh Peggesan.

Main article: History of Basilan
Early
In the order of tens of thousands of years ago, Melanesians arrived in the Philippines travelling down to Mindanao..Several thousands of years ago, Austronesians arrived in the Philippines, also travelling down to Mindanao.
Ancient history
The Yakan people arrived in the area of the Sulu Archipelago, of which Basilan is a part, around 300 BCE to 200 BCE..Little is known of them before the era of Spanish colonization, but they still make up the largest ethnic group on the main island of Basilan..It is believed that the Yakan people of Basilan made contact with the Kingdom of Champa in present-day Vietnam, and many of them have ancestries from Champa settlers, who later integrated with the Yakan.
As the Tausug Sultanate of Sulu grew in power, the Yakans withdrew inland, until most of the coastal communities along the island's southern, western and northwestern shores were primarily inhabited by Tausugs and their vassal tribes, the Samals and Bajaus (Tau-Laut)..The only exception was the relatively prosperous Yakan communities of Lamitan.
Taguima
Documents from the royal archives of the Sulu Sultanate referred to the northernmost island of the Sulu Archipelago as Taguima, from the Yakan who were called ""Tagihamas"" (people of the interior or hinterlands) by the Tausug and Samal peoples who came and settled in numerous scattered communities along Basilan's western and southwestern shores and outlying islets and island groups.
Later references mentioned ""Bantilan"", probably referring to Maluso, which was established as a major Tausug base by Sulu Sultan Muizz ud-Din (whose princely name was Datu Bantilan).
Imperial Chinese texts mention a ""Kingdom of Kumalarang"" (from the Yakan ""kumalang"" or ""to sing"", owing to the location being a place for celebrations and gatherings) during the Ming Dynasty, believed to be the island which now has a barangay of the same name on its northwestern shores.
Basilan was seen and mentioned by the remnants of the Ferdinand Magellan expedition in 1521.
The first Spanish map of Mindanao officially naming ""Basilan"" island (instead of Taguima/Tagyma) by Nicolas Norton Nicols, published in 1757.
The earliest map of the Philippines which made reference to an island labeled ""Taguima"" was produced by Giacomo Gastaldi, a map titled ""Die philippinische Inseln - Isle Brneo"" by Allain Manesson Mallet of Frankfurt, Germany featured an island labeled ""Tagyma I.""
The process by which all these names became ""Basilan"" is almost certainly due to miscommunication between the natives and the Spanish, as well as the penchant to engage in editorial license by European map-makers of the era.
Basilan's name may also derive from its iron ore deposits..Tausug warriors and slave-traders from Sulu came to Taguima to purchase high-quality magnetic iron ores, which they used for swords, knives and other blades..This profitable trade, helped in large measure by the establishment of Maluso as a major military-naval base of the Sulu Sultanate, eventually gave the island the distinction of being the source of basih-balan, the Tausug word for magnetic iron..Roughly translated and abbreviated, however, basih-lan means ""the iron (magnet) trail"" or ""the iron way"".
When several Tausug warriors were caught by the Spanish in one of their numerous raids on the Zamboanga settlement, Spanish officials supposedly admired the artistry and skill that went into making the warriors' elaborately decorated swords, knives and blades..They asked where these weapons could be bought..From atop the ramparts of the Spanish commandery at the Fuerza del Nuestra Senora del Pilar de Zaragoza (Fort Pilar), the warriors supposedly pointed to the island visible across today's Basilan Strait, and said, simply, ""ha basih-lan"".
Reports from the Jesuit reducciones in Zamboanga and Pasangen (Isabela) were relayed to Manila, where Spanish cartographer Pedro Murillo de Velarde published Historia de la Provincia de Philipinas de la Compañia de Jesvs..Segvnda parte using the Jesuit printing press at Manila in 1749..It featured a map of the Philippines with the unofficial ""I. Basilan""..The map was re-published by Leipzig map-maker Nicolaus Bellinn for general European circulation in 1752.
Finally, to represent a clear break from the Habsburg Dynasty (which had ruled Spain for 184 years from 1516 to 1700), the first officially sanctioned Spanish maps of its colonies, including ""Las Islas de Mindanao"", were commissioned by the Bourbons (1700–present)..This particular map of Mindanao, apparently copied from the Nicolaus Bellinn map of 1752, was published by Nicolas Norton Nicols in 1757, featuring ""Basilan"" and bearing the royal stamp of Spanish Bourbon King Ferdinand VI..It has been called ""Isla de Basilan"" (Basilan Island) ever since.
Spanish rule
It was eventually colonized by the Spanish as early as 1636 and was formally ceded by the Sulu Sultanate to Spain in 1726..The withdrawal of the Yakans inland was hastened by Spanish establishment of advance bases on the island's northwestern coast, bringing in Christianized 'indios' from Zamboanga, the Visayas and Luzon..By then, even the Yakan communities of Lamitan were completely overrun..Jesuit missionaries brought Catholicism to the region..Fighting with the Sultanate, the Dutch East India Company, Moro Pirates, and the French figured in Basilan's history over the years.
American invasion era
With its victory in the 1898 Spanish–American War, the United States gained possession of the Philippines..Americans proceeded to 'pacify' Basilan, cleared large expanses of land, and established plantations, mainly to produce rubber and copra.
Japanese occupation era
Following the Japanese occupation of the country during World War II, in 1946, the Philippines gained its independence..Beginning around 1970, heavy fighting broke out between the Philippine government and the Moro National Liberation Front, which was determined to secede and form a new country.
Philippine independence
In 1973, Basilan officially became a province carved out in the Province of Zamboanga del Sur.
Contemporary
The province joined the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao in 2001, it was last province to do so..Its former capital, Isabela City, opted out and remains a part of the Zamboanga Peninsula Region (formerly Western Mindanao, Region 9).
The capital town Lamitan became a component city by virtue of Republic Act No..9393 which sought to convert the town into a city..The law was ratified on June 18, 2007..However, the cityhood status was lost twice in the years 2008 and 2010 after the LCP questioned the validity of the cityhood law..The cityhood status was reaffirmed after the court finalized its ruling on February 15, 2011 which declared the cityhood law constitutional.
Geography
Basilan in Mindanao, Philippines (Regions IX, X, XII and BARMM)
Basilan is located between latitudes 6°15' and 7°00' and longitudes 121°15' and 122°30'..The island is bordered by the Basilan Strait to the north, the Sulu Sea to the northwest and west, the Moro Gulf to the northeast, and the Celebes Sea to the south, southeast and east.
Basilan is the largest and northernmost island of the Sulu Archipelago between the Philippine islands of Mindanao and Borneo which includes about 400 islands..Basilan Strait, about 17 nautical miles (31 km) at its narrowest point, separates Basilan Island from the mainland of Mindanao and the port city of Zamboanga..The terrain of the island is simple, with several undulating slopes concentrated around Isabela City along the coastal areas and hilly towards the interior..Urban areas are usually 2.5 metres (8 ft 2 in) above sea level and gently sloping to 300 metres (980 ft) towards the hinterlands..The stand of timber and forest vegetation is more or less evenly distributed throughout.
Topographical map of Basilan and outlying islands
The province encompasses Basilan Island and all nearby offshore islands, together with the Pilas Island group (now Hadji Muhtamad Municipality) west of the island, and the Bubuan and Tapiantana Island group (now Tabuan-Lasa Municipality) in the south..These are listed among the Philippine islands with a moderate risk of getting hit by tsunamis..The province has a land area of 132,723 hectares (327,970 acres) under its jurisdiction.
Basilan National Park is at the eastern portion of the remaining public forest between the city of Isabela and the municipalities of Lamitan, Tipo-Tipo and Sumisip..The park has an elevation of 971 metres (3,186 ft) above sea level, and the tallest peak, Puno Mahaji or Basilan Peak, dominates the park's landscape.

Basilan used to be part of Western Mindanao (the former name of Zamboanga Peninsula) but, in a recent plebiscite, the residents of some parts of Basilan opted to join ARMM, with the exception of Isabela..Originally called Pasangen (the rough English translation is ""town"") by natives, it still hosts the Basilan Provincial Capitol, the Governor's Executive Residence, the provincial offices of the executive departments and line agencies as well as most of the municipal offices of its neighboring municipalities..Starting in 1848 it was officially renamed Isabela de Basilan, derived from the Spanish fort built on the area where the present Provincial Capitol now stands — Fort Isabella Segunda — which, in turn, was named after Spanish Queen Isabella II..It was renamed Isabela Municipality in 1973 and formally as the City of Isabela on April 25, 2001.
Lamitan became a city in July 2007, although it remains in the ARMM..It is on the northeastern coast of Basilan, where most of Basilan's plains are..Lamitan is experiencing a renewed economic vigor that continues to power the rest of the province's otherwise lackluster growth..A November 18, 2008, decision of the Supreme Court, however, effectively voided the law converting Lamitan to a city after the League of Cities of the Philippines filed a petition earlier in the year..With 16 other local government units, Lamitan's cityhood was again voided in a Supreme Court decision handed down on August 26, 2010, returning it to the status of municipality..On February 17, 2011, the supreme court upheld for the third time the cityhood of Lamitan and 15 other towns in the Philippines.
Lamitan was proclaimed the new capital of Basilan since 2001, when Isabela opted out of the ARMM in a plebiscite held that year..Most provincial offices of the ARMM for Basilan are in Lamitan..Lamitan derives its name from Sultan Kudarat's capital town in the Mindanao mainland — Ramitan..The Iranun Sultan built a fortified base in the area to serve as a staging ground for raids on Spanish Zamboanga..The native Yakans regarded this as ""a place where people from Ramitan stayed"" or Kuta Ramitan..Eventually, the wooden fortress was razed to the ground by Gov..Gen. Corcuera in 1637..Natives just called the place ""Ramitan"", and substituting 'R' with 'L', the place gradually became known as simply Lamitan..It became the province's capital since 2017.
The other five original municipalities are:
Maluso is on the island's southwest, facing the bigger island of Sulu and Tawi-Tawi further south..Its busiest trading port is at Port Holland and Maluso Townsite..According to official accounts, the place derived its name from Spanish ""mal uso"" (trans..""bad manners""), after the supposedly crude manners of the natives of the place when they established their presence there in the later part of the 19th century.
Lantawan is in the island's westernmost area..It is mostly an agricultural area for copra and rubber production..Its biggest population concentration is Tairan..It has no major port..""Lantawan"" is derived from the native root word ""lantaw"" (trans..""look""), named after Basilan's westernmost peninsula's sloping hills which served as ""lookouts"" for natives who observed Tausug and Spanish vintas and ships pass by en route to another raid or naval attack on Jolo or Zamboanga.
Sumisip is the biggest municipality in land area and hosts what used to be the biggest rubber plantation (Sime Darby) in the Philippines.
Tuburan is on a peninsula on the extreme eastern part of the island, one of the least developed municipalities and severely devastated by the decades-old armed conflicts plaguing the island..""Tuburan"" is rooted in the native word ""tubod"" (trans..""water spring""), as there is said to be a spring in the area.
Tipo-Tipo, the last of the original municipalities created by the presidential decree of Ferdinand Marcos, is on the island's southeast coast..It is mostly undeveloped and witness to much of the running gun battles on the island..The place is named after the native word ""Tipun-tipunan"" (trans..""gathering place""), owing to its tendency for natives of the area to converge in this spot to exchange goods and food stuff with each other.
The latest six municipalities are creations of the regional legislature of the ARMM:
Akbar (MMA Act No..193), separated from Tuburan municipality in 2005, named after a political strongman, the late Congressman Wahab Akbar
Al-Barka (MMA Act No..191, ratified in 2006)
Hadji Mohammad Ajul (MMA Act No..192, ratified in 2006), from Tuburan, named after the first mayor of Tuburan
Hadji Muhtamad (MMA Act No..200, ratified in 2007), named after the father of late Wahab Akbar and separated from Lantawan
Tabuan-Lasa (created by virtue of MMA Act No..187, ratified in 2008) was separated from Sumisip and is named after the main islands of Tapiantana, Bubuan, Lanawan and Saluping.
Ungkaya Pukan (MMA Act No..190, ratified in 2006), named after Orang Kaya Pukan, ancestor of the Akbar family and nemesis of Datu Kalun
The new municipalities were created without the consent of the Philippine Congress..According to some accounts, said municipalities do not reach the basic requirements for the creation of a separate municipality (50 square kilometres (19 sq mi) area, P2.5 million income, and 25,000 population) under the Philippines' Local Government Code..(Recent Supreme Court rulings nullified the creation of Shariff Kabunsuan Province, created by the same ARMM Regional Assembly, reverting it to the 1st District of Maguindanao Province.).As a result, four of the six new municipalities have not been included in the government's annual budget as approved by Congress and have not received any nationally funded Internal Revenue Allotments (IRA) since their creation..These are Hadji Muhtamad, Hadji Mohammad Ajul, Al Barka and Akbar municipalities.

Demographics
Culture
Main article: Culture of Basilan
Santa Isabel Cathedral, in the heart of Isabela City's poblacion, is the center of Basilan's thriving Catholic community.
The biggest cultural influences on the island derive from Basilan's tri-ethnolingusitic community: the native Yakan, Tausug, and Chavacano peoples..The Yakans and Tausugs are predominantly Muslim, while the Chavacano are primarily Catholic.
Among the Tausugs and Samals, the phrase ""mag-tausug na kaw"" means ""become a Muslim"", instead of the more literal translation, ""become a Tausug"", as the Tausug ethnic is regarded as the ""original Muslims"" of the area..Although the majority of the Yakans are Muslims, a significant number conform to traditional local beliefs, traditions and rituals, while a few have likewise opted to be baptized Catholics..Along with a majority of the Chavacano, the Cebuano and the Ilonggo/Hiligaynon Bisaya are also Catholics.
Yakan interior/east: Yakans gathered at Materling, Al Barka (Tipo-Tipo), Basilan, visited by Kapamilya broadcaster Bernadette Sembrano.
Culturally, the Yakan and the Tausug are distinct ethnolinguistic nations; the Yakan represent the ""Lumad"" (albeit lately most Yakans have since converted to Islam) or indigenous peoples of Basilan, while the Tausugs, the Samal and the Bajao are regarded as the ""original Muslims"", and the Chavacano, Cebuano and Ilonggo are the ""Cristianos""..The rest, a mixture of Ilocanos, Waray, Bicolanos, Maranaos, Iranuns and Maguindanaos, are more recent migrants permanently residing in the region, itinerant merchants or government workers.
This mix of ethnicities, forged first by the Spanish practice of establishing re-settlements or reducciones, as well as the multinational plantations' importation of skilled Christian farm workers and laborers from the Visayas and Luzon, gives Basilan a distinct culture in the Philippines..It is the only predominantly Muslim province that is governed primarily by its indigenous population and whose most commonly spoken language is Chavacano.
Catholic north/northwest: J. S. Alano Street, one of the main thoroughfares of Isabela City, connecting Santa Isabel Cathedral with the Isabela City Plaza/Plaza Rizal and the Provincial Capitol.
The Tausugs and Samals, for the most part having been denied ownership of land, and owing to their primary livelihood of fishing, live along the coastlines, constructing their houses on stilts at the water's edge near population centers..Their houses are, for the most part, outside of the municipal water and sewerage systems of the urban centers..This group controls nearly 100% of the bountiful aquatic resources that surround the island.
The Yakans, on the other hand, having been driven far inland, are scattered throughout the island's interior, in similar raised houses usually made of light materials, but separated from each other..Yakans control nearly all Local Government Units, and since the late 80s have found employment in Government jobs..The Christians are mostly found in the plains, the cities and in the plantations, squeezed between the Tausug-dominated coasts and the Yakan-dominated hinterlands..They make up the bulk of the island's professionals, entrepreneurs, and lowland farmers..The Christians, however, own most of the arable land, as well as nearly all of the businesses and occupy most of the professions.
Tausug/Samal festivals are usually connected to the sea, celebrating the bounty of the seas, even staging dazzling fluvial wedding parades on colorfully bedecked vintas and paraws, a nod to the Tausugs' former naval prowess..Catholic fiestas are almost always related to good harvests on the farms, as well as saintly miracles against natural calamities and victories against Moro attacks in the past..Yakan festivals, meanwhile, are rooted in older, pre-Islamic rituals such as warrior dances, colorful wedding pageants, and harvest rituals.
Culturally, therefore, the Chavacanos, Cebuanos, and Tausugs have had a close relationship, both professionally as well as in trade and commerce, being regarded as the island's ""lowlanders"" by the Yakan, who are regarded as ""de arriba"" by the Chavacanos or ""tagihamas"" by the Suluanon Tausugs, which roughly translates as ""uplanders""..Conversely, the Yakan have reason to be suspicious of the intents and motives of their lowland neighbors, having been at the receiving end of slave raids, invasions and punitive attacks from both groups for over 500 years.
With the island's strategic location right at the crossroads of the warring camps of Tausugs and the Spanish, Basilan was divided into three primary spheres of cultural dominance by one of the three groups..Basilan's northern and northwestern coasts, facing the heavily Hispanized Zamboanga City across the narrow Basilan Strait, is culturally Christian, or more precisely Catholic..Basilan's southern and southwestern coastal areas have a distinctly Tausug-oriented culture..The eastern and interior portions of Basilan, on the other hand, isolated for the most part from the Spanish in Zamboanga, and the Tausug from Jolo, are enclaves of the indigenous Yakan.

Basilan ethnicity profile
By the eve of the Commonwealth era in the Philippines, local census estimates showed that a majority of the people of Basilan were Christian migrants, mostly plantation workers recruited from over Mindanao and the Visayas, and Tausug traders, as well as Samal and Bajau fisherfolk..Only around 5,000 Yakans were counted in the census..Until then, most Yakans preferred not to interact directly with their lowland neighbors.
Statistics from the 2010 Census report () the following breakdown (out of a total 391,179 population):
Indigenous Yakan: 161,791 (41.36%)
Christians, i.e., Chavacano / Visayans (which includes Cebuano and Hiligaynon) / Ilocano, etc..: 128,698 (32.9%)
Other Muslim Tribes, i.e., Tausug / Samal / Bajao / Iranon: 100,690 (25.74%)
Basilan Province population distribution (NSO figures 2010)
The following figures in this subsection are from the National Statistical Coordination Board, NSCB Philippine Database, Census of 2010, unless otherwise noted.
Basilan' median age was 19 years, lower than the 1995 figure of 25 years.
The sex ratio is almost even..There were 166,413 males and 166,415 females in the 2000 CPH..However, there were more females in the 15-to-39 age group and more males in all other age groups.
The economically active population, ages 15 to 64, comprises 55.2% of the population..About 42.3% are young dependents (0 to 14 years old) while fewer than 3% are old dependents (64 years old and older)..The overall dependency ratio is 81.2: for every 100 persons ages 15 to 64, there were about 77 young dependents and 4 old dependents.
Married people accounted for 47.76% of the total people 10 years old and over, lower than the 1995 figure (49.11%)..Single people comprised 43.80% in 2000, a decrease from 45.71% in 1995..The widowed (4.49%) increased less than one percentage point from the figure registered in 1995 (3.89%)..Those with other arrangements increased from 3.87% in 1995 to 4.49% in 2000.
Out of 60,710 housing units in Basilan, 60,699 (99.98%) were occupied by 61,546 households..This rate of occupancy was higher than that of 1990 (95.6%)..There was a ratio of 1.01 households for every occupied housing unit or 5.48 persons per occupied housing unit.
A large proportion (94.3%) of the occupied housing units in Basilan in 2000 were single houses..75.9% of the occupied housing units did not need repair or with minor repair, while 17.8% needed major repair..One out of nine occupied housing units were built between 1996 and 2000.
The proportion of occupied housing units with roofs made of galvanized iron/aluminum rose from 23.1% in 1990 to 42.5% in 2000..On the other hand, roofs made of cogon/nipa/anahaw declined from 69.6% in 1990 to 50.3% in 2000..As for the construction material of the outer walls, the use of wood rose from 42.2% in 1990 to 52.4% in 2000.
Out of Basilan's estimated 60,582 families, 19,740 lived in urban areas and 40,842 were rural..Average poverty thresholds province-wide were pegged at Php9,271.00 monthly family income, of which Php10,997.00 was considered the urban threshold and Php8,080.00 the threshold for rural families..26.20% of the total population was below the poverty threshold: 36.50% of the urban population and 21.20% of the rural.
Poverty incidence is defined as the proportion of families whose income cannot provide for the basic food and non-food requirements called the poverty threshold to the total number of families..According to the ARMM government website, in 2006, Basilan ranked 46th among all provinces, with a poverty incidence of 31.7.
Population growth 2000-2007
Basilan experienced a rapid increase in population; between 2000 and 2007, the population increased by 163,675, from 332,828 to 496,503, which is an annual growth rate of 5.67%, whereas it only rose by 37,263 between 1995 and 2000, an annual growth rate of 2.25%..A corresponding increase in the number of households was also registered, from 55,137 in 1995 to 61,546 in 2000..This resulted to an average household size of 5.4 persons, higher than the national average of five.
Of the seven original municipalities in Basilan as of May 1, 2000, Isabela, then capital of the province, was the largest in terms of population with 73,032 persons or 21.94% of the provincial total..It was followed by Lamitan (17.64%), Sumisip (15.23%), Tipo-Tipo (14.50%), and Tuburan (12.78%)..Lantawan and Maluso, on the other hand, had less than 10% each.

By 2007, the three biggest local government units (LGUs) saw their shares of the population fall relative to neighboring communities; Isabela City fell to 17.72% of Basilan's total population despite remaining the most densely populated area on the island..Lamitan is now only at 16.53% (-1.11%)..Old Sumisip (two municipalities with a population of 71,807), with the biggest aggregate land area, fell to 14.46% (-0.77%)..Meanwhile, Old Tipo-Tipo (three municipalities: 83,249 pop.).rose to 16.75% (+2.25%) and is now bigger than Lamitan, while Old Tuburan (three municipalities: 73,942 pop.).is 14.89% (+2.11%) and is now bigger than Old Sumisip..Old Lantawan (two municipalities: 49,270 pop.).is at 9.92%, while Maluso (48,175 pop.).comprises 9.7% of the total.
The seven-year increases are widely disparate, which explains the 2000–2007 percentage figures stated above..In Isabela City, the population growth was 20.47% (+2.60% per annum; 73,032 in 2000, to 87,985 in 2007), slower when compared to the newly created Akbar Municipality, scene of many of the latest gun-battles between government troops and Moro separatist groups..The municipality's seven-year population growth was 101.42% (+10.14% per annum; 10,581 in 2000 to 21,312 in 2007)..The average aggregate annual population increase in the seven-year period for the ten municipalities and one city that comprise Basilan was 9.12%..By comparison, that of the rest of the Philippines was only 2.3%.
These figures are derived from the National Statistics and Coordination Board and Philippine Statistics Authority.
These rapid growth rates have been attributed mainly to the practice of local governments of padding their real population numbers to
obtain a bigger slice of the Internal Revenue Allotment fund given to Philippine LGUs,
fulfill minimum requirements set by the Philippine Local Government Code (for the newly created municipalities and Lamitan city)
as well as a reserve of votes for local political clans from constituencies that ""usually"" record 100% turn-outs during election periods.
Basilan Census 2010
The rapid growth between 2000 and 2007 is replaced by a drastic reduction in the 2007–2010 figures after the previous figures were subjected to stricter statistical analyses, reflecting a more statistically plausible growth trajectory from 2000 to 2010.
As a result, Basilan's 2010 population declined from 496,503 to 391,179, a contraction of 105,324 or -21.21%, a PGR of −8.31%.
Out of Basilan's two Cities and 11 Municipalities, only two LGUs registered increases in population:
Isabela City grew from 87,985 to 97,857, an increase of 9,872 or +11.22% (3.95% PGR); and
Tabuan Lasa grew from 13,384 to 18,635, an increase of 5,251 or +39.23% (12.80% PGR).
The rest recorded drastic declines in population:
Lamitan City, from 82,074 to 68,996, a decline of 13,078 or -14.86% (−6.12% PGR);
Sumisip, from 58,423 to 37,031, a decline of 21,392 or -36.61% (−15.29% PGR);
Maluso, from 48,175 to 33,803, a decline of 14,372 or -29.83% (−12.10% PGR);

Basilan Faith Profile
The majority of Basilan's population is Muslim, accounting for 65%..The others are mostly Christian (mainly Roman Catholic), accounting for 33% of the population..A majority of Basilan's Muslim population (41%) practice Sunni Islam of the Shafi'i tradition, as taught by Arab, Persian, Indian Muslim, and Malay missionaries from the 14th century onwards..A substantial remainder follow a syncretist mix of Islam and Yakan folk customs and traditions exclusively among the native Yakan populations farther inland, and a different version of the same folk Islamic tradition which is practiced by the Bajao in Basilan's outlying islands and surrounding seas.
A majority of Basilan's Muslims are concentrated on the island's southern slopes while Christians reside mostly in the urban centers of Isabela and Lamitan on the island's northern coast, where they constitute a majority..Sizable Christian settlements are also found in the former multi-national plantations, for example Tairan, Lantawan; Tumahubong, Sumisip; Maluso Townsite, Maluso..The rest have a mixture of traditional and autochthonal beliefs.
Relatively newer Islamic sects, mostly brought by returning veterans of the Afghan wars and missionaries from Pakistan's stricter Sufi traditions, referred to as the Tableegh, have been active in propagating what they believe to be a ""purer"" Islamic way of life and worship..A very small number who have since married into Iranian or Iraqi families have converted to Shiite Islam.
Catholicism
The Jesuit mission established in 1637 was replaced by a parish when Basilan was reassigned to the Order of Augustinian Recollects in 1850..The Jesuits regained Isabela Parish from 1860 to 1880, and then lost it again to the Recollects, who administered the parish until 1920, at which time Isabela de Basilan was turned over to diocesan priests until 1930..From 1930 through 1950, the Jesuits returned to Isabela, finally relinquishing their long-held outpost to the Claretian Fathers, who took over from 1951 to 1974.
The Isabela Parish burned to the ground in 1962 and was rebuilt in 1964 under the aegis of Basilan's first bishop, José María Querexeta, a Spaniard..The cathedral was consecrated to Santa Isabel in 1970, and diocesan priests have since administered the same from 1974 to the present..The cathedral figured prominently in the news, suffering one destructive explosion in a triple bomb blast on April 13, 2010.
The Prelature of Isabela de Basilan was created on October 12, 1963, and comprises all territories constituting the civil jurisdiction of Basilan Province, including Isabela..Its titular patron is Santa Isabel de Portugal.
Bishop Querexeta was succeeded by Bishop Rómulo T. de la Cruz, Basilan's first Filipino bishop, on February 16, 1989, who served until January 10, 2002, when the present bishop, Martin S. Jumoad took over.
Others
Non-Catholic Christians include Evangelicals, Jesus Miracle Crusade, Episcopalian, and Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), Mormons, Seventh-day Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and other Protestant denominations..Only the most recent Chinese immigrants adhere to Buddhism or Taoism, while most of the older Chinese families have acculturated and have either converted to Christianity or Islam while retaining most of their Chinese beliefs.
Language
Native Zamboangueño Chavacano speakers in Mindanao.
Basilan is home to several ethnolinguistic groups that have their own native vernacular, the main ones being Chavacano, Tausug, Yakan, and Cebuano (Bisaya)..Chavacano is the primary native tongue of the Christian inhabitants of the island and serves as the lingua franca of Basilan, with 80% of residents being able to speak and understand it..Basilan has the biggest concentration of Chavacano speakers in the Philippines outside of Zamboanga City..Tausug is also widely spoken, especially among the Muslims, and is spoken and understood by approximately 70% of Basilan's population..Cebuano is a preferred third tongue among the Christian and even the Muslims because of the mass influx of Cebuano settlers to Mindanao, especially among the Tausūg people since the Tausug language is a Visayan language like Cebuano and is spoken and understood by approximately 70% of Basilan's residents..Yakan, the acknowledged native language of Basilan, is used primarily by Yakans, although it is spoken and understood by about 15%-20% of the non-Yakan residents..A lesser percentage can speak or understand Samal/Banguingui and Iranon, which are mostly confined to members of their respective ethnolinguistic groups..Many locals and barter traders can speak Sabah Malay.
Tagalog and English are used for official business or government transactions..Hokkien Chinese is used by the immigrant Chinese community and their descendants..Arabic is mostly used in Muslim prayers and songs and seldom spoken as an everyday vernacular.
Education
Basilan National High School, Isabela, Basilan's premier secondary institution
Basilan's literacy rate has risen over the past two decades, although it remains one of the Philippines' lowest; 72.23% are considered literate, as opposed to the national figure of 92.6%.
The province has one state college and five private colleges..Basilan State College is located in Isabela and has an extension college in Lamitan and Maluso..Among the private colleges, there is Computer Technologies Institute-Isabela (est..1997) and The Mariam School of Nursing in Lamitan (est..2004).
Furigay Colleges, Lamitan City, Basilan
Basilan is served by three school divisions of the Department of Education, one each for Basilan, Isabela, and Lamitan..The first two are headquartered in Isabela City, and the latter is in Lamitan City.
Public and private high schools dot the province..The premier secondary educational institution on the island is Basilan National High School in Isabela, followed by Lamitan National High School in Lamitan..The Claret High Schools of Isabela, Lamitan, Maluso and Tumahubong, and a number of Madaris provide private elementary and secondary instruction..Claret College of Isabela is the only Claretian institution which offers tertiary level education in the Philippines..Other schools offering stand-alone senior high school are Computer Technologies Institute-Isabela and The Mariam School of Nursing, Inc.-Lamitan.
More than 42% of the population five years old and older attended or completed elementary education, 17.3% attended or completed high school, while 1.5% attended or finished post secondary education..Less than 3% possessed academic degrees, while 6.2 percent were college undergraduates..A very small number pursued post-baccalaureate studies..There were more males than females among those who attended or finished elementary (51.1%), high school (50.3%), among college undergraduates (52.0%) and those who took post baccalaureate courses (58.4%)..On the other hand, there were more females who attended or completed post-secondary courses (52.9%) and were academic degree holders (52.34%).

Basilan Economic Profile
Agriculture is the main source of economic livelihood..Basilan's major products include coconut (primarily copra), rubber, coffee, black pepper, and African palm oil..Other crops are palay, corn, cacao and cassava.
The Sulu and Celebes Seas provide fish such as tuna, mackerel, and sardines..Most of these are processed in canning factories in nearby Zamboanga City, General Santos (the Philippines' tuna capital), and Navotas..The island's waters also produce grouper, squid, octopus, and marlin, while fishponds supply milkfish, prawn and shrimp..In addition, seaweed is cultivated along some coastal areas.
The island of Omosmarata in Tuburan (now Mohammad Ajul) is listed among only 15 sites in the Philippines with commercially viable ocean thermal energy potential..The Philippines' ocean thermal resource area is 1000 square kilometers, based on the archipelagic nature of the country..Based on a study conducted by the Philippines Department of Energy, the potential capacity for this resource is estimated to be 265 million megawatts.
Likewise, the Basilan Strait is listed among only eight sites in the Philippines with commercially viable ocean tidal energy potential (along with Bohol/Talibon Strait, Basiao Channel, Surigao Strait, Gaboc Channel, Hinatuan Passage, San Bernardino Strait and San Juanico Strait).
Only the provinces of Basilan, Samar and Surigao have both high ocean thermal and ocean tidal energy potential..Basilan likewise has significant as yet underdeveloped mineral deposits, specifically, iron ore, gold, manganese, copper, and coal.
Alienable and disposable lands cover 862.249 square kilometres (332.916 sq mi), forest lands occupy 406.526 square kilometres (156.961 sq mi), 294.194 square kilometres (113.589 sq mi) are underused, 574.85 square kilometres (221.95 sq mi) are under forest cultivation, while 689.479 square kilometres (266.209 sq mi) are under agricultural cultivation.
Local products include woven cloth and trinkets made by the Yakan tribe..Yakans use fibers from plants such as pineapple for their crafts..The weavers traditionally used extracts from leaves, roots and barks to dye their fibers..However, contact with U.S. Peace Corps workers and Christian Filipinos has influenced Yakan textile art..One influence is the introduction of chemical dyes..The museum of Lamitan displays the colorful and intricate traditional Yakan textiles and highlights of the traditional Yakan festival, Lami-lamihan.
Early history
Basilan's economy has seen wild upswings and downturns over the course of several centuries..Pre-Hispanic Taguima had an economy based on basic subsistence agriculture, mostly root crops..Ancient Chinese texts point to the existence of a ""Kingdom of Kumalarang"", which presumably was located on the island's northwestern shore, and which occasionally traded with Chinese merchants plying the route to the Spice Islands of the Moluccas and Borneo farther south.
When the Spanish arrived, other crops such as rice and corn were introduced and cultivated, primarily for consumption by the growing Christian settlements of Isabela and Lamitan..Trade with Zamboanga grew tremendously, as most of the settlers' needs were supplied by regular shipments from the busy Zamboanga port.
Multinational plantations

When the United States assumed control of the Philippines after its victory in the Spanish–American War, it brought about the single biggest change in the local economy..By around 1914, Dr. James W. Strong, a pioneering American plantation owner, cleared vast tracts of land on the island's northern plains (Isabela/Lamitan), and established what became the Philippines' first commercial rubber plantation—the American Rubber Co..Upon consulting with Fr..Zamora, a noted botanist of the University of Santo Tomas in Manila, he decided to start experimenting with rubber plants and in 1910, forming the Basilan Rubber Plantation in partnership with J.M..Menzi Corporation as principal stock holders..Seven years later, he sold out his interest to J.M..Menzi Corporation and started American Rubber Co. backed by San Francisco capital..He started building roads in Basilan with the help of his children..Those roads are now part of the National Highway system in Basilan.
The family and plantation prospered and was visited by such notables as Manuel L. Quezon, President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, his vice-president Sergio Osmeña, General Douglas MacArthur and assorted Governor Generals and High Commissioners for the Philippines.
The 913-hectare plantation was eventually sold to American multi-national B. F. Goodrich through its local subsidiary American Rubber Plantation Corp..This was followed by investments from British-Malayan firm Sime Darby Corp., which opened their 1,651 hectares (4,080 acres) rubber plantation on the island's southern slopes (Sumisip/Tipo-Tipo).
The success of these large-scale cash crop plantations was emulated by a number of enterprising Filipinos and Spanish-mestizo families from Zamboanga, Negros and Luzon..Among these were Don Juan S. Alano, a Hispano-Chinese mestizo and native of Malolos, Bulacan, who opened the Philippine National Sugar Co. on Malamawi Island in 1921..This eventually became the Basilan Estates, Inc., the only 100% Filipino-owned plantation competing with American and British multi-nationals..It operated the Malamawi Island plantation, which was converted to coconut/copra production, and opened a 1,434-hectare copra plantation on the island's western plains (Tairan, Lantawan), Basilan's third-largest plantation in land area..American logging firms Weyerhaeuser Timber Co. and the American Lumber Co. opened large-scale logging concessions which operated in Basilan's extensive upland virgin forest..Menzi Agricultural Corporation, owned by Hispano-German J. M. Menzi, opened a 991-hectare rubber plantation in the southern part of Isabela which eventually expanded to black pepper and palm oil.
The University of the Philippines System was awarded a huge 4,018-hectare land grant by the Philippine government, in Santa Clara, Lamitan..This was eventually taken over by the Marcos-era National Development Corp.
When J. M. Menzi died, he was succeeded at the helm of his substantial business interests by his son and Marcos crony, Hans Menzi..When the younger Menzi replaced the plantation's Swiss-expatriate managers with locals, these managers in turn opened up their own plantations elsewhere on the island..Arnold Winniger, Menzi's Swiss manager, together with the Cuevas-Pamaran-Antonio-Flores clan of Lamitan, cleared the Tumahubong, Sumisip area with their 316-hectare Siltown Realty Corp. Walter Boelsterli, another one of Menzi's Swiss recruits, established the 969-hectare Eurasia Match Inc. plantation around Mangal, Sumisip..An American corporation opened the 1,127-hectare Yakan Plantation in Lamitan..This was eventually sold to JAKA Holdings of Marcos-era Defense Minister and current senator Juan Ponce Enrile..Finally, Dutch-American Donald Wieselski opened another 569-hectare coconut plantation in the Canas, Maluso area..This too was sold off to Eustaquio D. Tan & Sons, Inc..The Wihara Plantation, a Japanese company, opened in the Atong-Atong, Lantawan region..This became the source of many of the coconut varieties planted throughout the island.

By the 1950s and throughout the 1960s, the Chartered City of Basilan, fourth-biggest in the Philippines in terms of land area (after Davao, Puerto Princesa and Zamboanga), was classified as a first-class city..It exported copra, coconut oil, rubber and lumber to California by way of Guam and Hawaii.
A substantial number of expatriate plantation managers, mostly Americans but also Swiss, Germans, Dutch, Russian and even Japanese, Irish, and Swedes lived among and intermarried into the native populace.
The Weyerhaeuser Compound (now Tabuk Barangay) was an exclusive gated community for American expatriates living in Basilan..It had its own airstrip and wharf, and two-storey plantation-style villas set apart by expansive yards..The same sort of exclusive gated communities were put up at the Menzi Compound (Menzi Barangay) for Swiss and German managers, and at the Alano Compound (Dna..Ramona T. Alano Barangay) as well, precursors of modern-day subdivisions and exclusive gated communities in the Philippines.
The Moro uprising
MNLF fighters surrender their firearms to President Ferdinand Marcos.
The Moro uprising of 1971 affected Basilan's economy..It was led by Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) originating from Sulu, headed by University of the Philippines lecturer Nur Misuari..This was compounded by the declaration of martial law by President Ferdinand Marcos in 1972, and the decree that created Basilan Province, with its initial complement of ten municipalities (eventually reduced to seven).
Politics took center stage, and the resurgent Yakan uplanders found themselves battling the Tausug lowlanders and their allies..The incessant Yakan-Tausug pocket battles throughout the 1980s culminated in the burning of Isabela City's downtown market in 1987..After several revenge killings, Basilan gained notoriety as the Philippines' ""Wild, Wild West""..By then, Basilan's economy, along with that of the rest of the nation, was limping along, barely surviving the aftermath of these struggles.
Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program and the rise of Abu Sayyaf
See also: Land reform in the Philippines
At the onset of the post-Marcos administration of Corazon Aquino, another blow was dealt to Basilan's economy..In 1988, Congress passed a law establishing the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP), which inaugurated a land distribution program, effectively dissolving nearly all of the corporate plantations on the island..CARP applied to Basilan's large multi-national plantations despite the plantation workers' misgivings and the landowners' objections..Almost immediately, the large multi-national corporations withdrew their investments from Basilan, leaving their plantations to ill-equipped farmer beneficiaries, who managed operations in a farmers cooperative format.
The J. S. Alano coconut plantation was converted into the Tairan Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Association and Multi-Purpose Cooperative (TARBAMC), the University of the Philippines Basilan Land Grant into the Santa Clara Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Integrated Development Cooperative (SCARBIDC), and the American Rubber (B.F. Goodrich) rubber plantation was converted into the Latuan Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Association Inc. (LARBAI)..The vast tracts of the Enrile-owned Cocoland Plantation, was redistributed as the Lamitan Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Cooperative (LARBECO)..A number of other Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Cooperatives have likewise taken over most of the small to mid-sized plantations on the island.
The Philippine government's initial rapprochement with the Nur Misuari-led Moro National Liberation Front throughout the 1980s established the 7,281-hectare Basilan Resettlement Area which was set aside for MNLF rebel-returnees and their communities located on the western slopes of Basilan Peak, mostly in northern Sumisip, but also in southern Isabela, and northeastern Maluso..This vast area was eventually subdivided into four Agrarian Reform Cooperatives, all of which were established in 1991.
Political map of Zamboanga Peninsula
By the early 1990s, disgruntled youth, influenced by returning mujahideen warriors from the thwarted Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and schooled in more radical schools of thought in Syria, Egypt and Pakistan, banded together to form the Al-Harakatul Al-Islamiyah, better known worldwide as Abu Sayyaf, an extremist group advocating strict Islamic governance similar to Afghanistan's Taliban regime..This group initiated test raids, kidnappings, ambushes and assassinations in some of the most vulnerable communities inland, causing the dispersal of these communities and total breakdown of the inland economy.
As more and more of the group's pioneering leaders were captured or gunned down, the group gradually transformed from being radical ideologues to becoming plain lawless elements or bandits, prone to committing heinous crimes, usually kidnapping for ransom and bombings throughout Mindanao, Palawan (Dos Palmas) and even Malaysia (Sipadan Is..).
The group's founding leader, the radical firebrand Abdurajak Janjalani of Isabela City, is a typical product of Basilan's closely mixed ethnicities and inter-marriages: he is part-Tausug, part-Yakan and part-Ilonggo.
Inclusion in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao
The Organic Act for the creation of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) was passed into law in 1989..A plebiscite held in 14 Mindanao provinces was held in the same year..Basilan initially opted out of the autonomous region..Only Maguindanao (without Cotabato City), Lanao del Sur (without Marawi City), Sulu and Tawi-Tawi joined the ARMM.
More than a decade later, in 2001, a new law expanding the ARMM was passed, and a plebiscite was subsequently held..While Basilan's five Muslim municipalities (Maluso, Sumisip, Lantawan, Tipo-Tipo, Tuburan) opted to join the expanded ARMM, residents of the Christian areas of Isabela City and Lamitan Municipality, chose not to..Even then, only Isabela was not included in the expanded ARMM, having been granted cityhood earlier in the same year..Lamitan joined the five other municipalities, as Basilan was officially incorporated into the expanded ARMM.
Basilan security profile
Widespread corruption in the ARMM, compounded by corruption at the municipal and provincial levels, further eroded business confidence in the island..This, plus the surge of terrorist activities carried out by Abu Sayyaf and their Jemaah Islamiyah cohorts in the international terrorist network of Al-Qaeda, weakened Basilan's economy further.
The hostage crisis of 2001 further raised questions about Basilan's economic future..Operations by Abu Sayyaf damaged prospects for investment and tourism..However, an increased presence by the Philippine and U.S. militaries through the Balikatan 02-1 Joint Military Exercises and the subsequent death of Abu Sayyaf leaders Khadafi Abubakar Janjalani and Aldam Tilao (aka Abu Sabaya), were followed by investments by the United States through USAID..Projects include the Basilan Tuburan Road Improvement Project and improvements to Lamitan and Maluso Ports..Smaller barangay infrastructure projects, intended to help boost economic growth, are also under development..For instance, authorities are building farm-to-market roads, community and trade centers, water projects, and pedestrian bridges, according to USAID information.
A number of other ODA-funded Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) and People's Organizations (POs) flooded Basilan starting in 2002..These NGOs and POs provided much-needed capital infusion for local entrepreneurs to restart defunct or dying business enterprises..Likewise, improved training and government-funded support were extended to decade-old Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Cooperatives, effectively improving productivity levels and crop yields..Extensive farm management training in these ""Coop"" areas have likewise improved business efficiency in the cooperatives.
Currently, Basilan's minimum wage is US$3.20/day for non-agriculture related jobs, and US$2.80/day for agriculture related jobs..There are only 1,203 registered Overseas Contract Workers from Basilan.
Return of rubber

By 2003, Basilan embarked on large-scale replanting programs covering some 50,000 hectares (120,000 acres) of privately owned and/or cooperative-controlled lands, mainly for rubber and cassava..As of 2006, the province had 15,503 hectares (38,310 acres) planted, of which 7,148 hectares (17,660 acres) were owned by individual farmers and the rest by cooperatives..The exact land area devoted to rubber could reach over 20,000 hectares (49,000 acres), as there are hundreds of unrecorded small rubber growers and farmers..The provincial government reports that almost half or 7,029.47 hectares (17,370.2 acres) are immature, about a fifth or 3,143.36 hectares (7,767.4 acres) is classed as ""less-productive"", and a little under a third or 4,880.21 hectares (12,059.3 acres) is described as ""productive.""
A consortium of agrarian reform beneficiaries has been formed to improve quality and increase production..The Isla Corridor Consortium Agrarian Reform Communities not only sees itself as reviving the rubber industry, it also wants to help in the transformation of the battle-scarred province..The consortium, composed of the United Workers Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Multipurpose Cooperative, Lamitan Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Cooperative, Santa Clara, and the Latuan Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Association, Inc., accounts for a total area of about 6,000 hectares (15,000 acres), some 80% of which is planted with rubber trees.
Coconut
Copra processing plant in Isabela City, Basilan
Although it is still the biggest single crop produced in the province, coconut/copra production annually was only 193,848 metric tons in 2003, down from its peak production of 189,297,937 metric tons just two years before..Coconut plantations and small coconut farms cover more than 12,000 hectares (30,000 acres), all of which are classified as ""productive"" to ""mature"" areas..However, province-wide coconut production, which still accounts for 50%-60% of the province's total economic activity, has dropped precipitously to only 174,939 metric tons in 2002 due to the lingering effects of CARP, combined with a severe onset of the El Niño weather pattern, the worsening threat to peace and order resulting from the resurgent Abu Sayyaf terrorist group and their MILF allies, and the policy of the Akbar administration to replace coconut with rubber trees.
Coconut plantations began to revive in 2006, owing to the steep rise in copra prices..A comprehensive replanting and rehabilitation program is currently being implemented by the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) and the Department of Agriculture for the resuscitation of the island's copra production industry, once the Philippine's second-largest copra exporter after Quezon Province in Luzon..To date, however, coconut production in the province, rapidly being replaced by rubber plantations, has remained in the doldrums despite the government's best efforts to revive the ailing sector, such as PCA incentives to coconut farmers.

The province is also serviced by satellite offices of government financing institutions such as the Social Security System and the Government Service Insurance System.
The Basilan business sector is represented by the Philippine Chamber of Commerce & Industry, Inc.-Basilan Chamber (PCCI-Basilan), organized in 1975, the only business support organization duly affiliated with the Philippine Chamber of Commerce & Industry, Inc. (PCCI), with 95% of its members being composed of small and medium enterprises, and offices mostly in Isabela City and Lamitan, but with business assets and operations throughout the island..A number of smaller business groups have since been established catering to the needs of businessmen from specific ethnic or religious affiliations.
Utilities, infrastructure and health
Basilan's electricity needs are served by the Basilan Electric Cooperative, powered by three diesel-powered electricity generating plants located at Barangay Binuangan, Isabela, one National Power Corporation diesel-powered barge located at Barangay Tabuk, Isabela, and two mini-hydroelectric plants located in Kumalarang, Isabela and Balagtasan, Lamitan..A total of 62 sitios, in 42 barangays spread out in 6 municipalities still do not have access to electricity..Only about 38% of Barangays are sufficiently powered for modern needs, and most of these are located in the cities of Isabela and Lamitan, and Maluso Municipality..Rates are currently pegged at US$0.824/kwH (Php11.42/kwH), one of the highest in the country..Basilan has a total electricity demand of 8.8MW (peak hours), and has a total reliable electricity supply of only 7.4MW, thus resulting in one of the country's longest intermittent blackout spells, running for several years now.
Basilan is served by three local water utilities: Isabela City Water District, Lamitan City Water District, and Maluso Water District..Only 17,693 households, however, have full access to safe and potable water..Current rates are pegged at an average US$3.20/month (+US$0.0826/10 cu.m.)
The island is served by the Provincial Telephone System, which has 600 land-line connections and connected with National Direct Dial via the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company..It is also served by major mobile telecommunications carriers Globe Telecommunications and Smart Communications..It has two Wi-Fi internet Service provider, and numerous internet cafes.

Basilan Provincial Capitol
Basilan's politics has been dictated by its economics..Whereas only 33% of the island's residents originate from Christian tribes in the Visayas and Luzon, this group owns 70% of the island's developed arable agricultural land (private ownership or cooperatives as farmer beneficiaries)..The Yakan tribe, comprising 41% of the island's population, has full control of local governments outside of Isabela and Lamitan..The Tausugs, Samals and Bajaus, forming 25% of the population, control nearly 90% of the island's aquatic harvest, while the minuscule Chinese segment of the population controls nearly 100% of all commodity trading and commerce activities, especially in the bigger cities.
This volatile mix of ethnic and religious groups have defined political realignments in the island for most of its history..The Christian tribes, traditionally allied with the Tausugs, controlled Basilan politics until the 1980s, when the Yakans, aided by their almost absolute control of the hinterlands and the disappearance of the multi-national plantations, scored upset victories in electoral contests starting in 1988.
Present-day Isabela City Plaza (formerly Plaza Misericordia; note the Rizal monument and Plaza Rizal in the background)
This political combine has since seen some in-fighting from two of the most formidable power blocks to have formed since the 2004 general elections..Both blocks went head-to-head in the 2007, 2010 and 2013 local elections with mixed results.
The Akbar block (Liberal Party - Atienza Wing & Lakas-CMD/Kampi) was led by the late Wahab Akbar, three-term Basilan governor and clan patriarch, together with his wives, and his nephews and nieces, all of whom won mayoral posts in all the municipalities as well as Isabela City, which is under his second wife Cherrylyn Santos-Akbar..Hja..Jum Jainuddin-Akbar, the incumbent three-term Governor of Basilan assumed the leadership of the block after Wahab Akbar himself, who was elected congressman in 2007, was assassinated in November 13 of that year..Cases were filed against Gerry Salapuddin ang Mujiv Hataman, having been accused of having master-minded the assassination..The 2013 Elections proved the staying power of the Akbars as the clan, celebrating the twin victories of both Governor Jum and Mayor Cherry, heralded the election of Alfiya Akbar-Fernandez, eldest daughter of Gov..Akbar, as the top-notcher Provincial Board Member for District 1, and Al Qaid Akbar, eldest son, who won as Isabela City Councilor..The Akbars won all of their electoral contests since 1998..Gov..Jum Akbar won in all Cities and Municipalities in Basilan, except Hdji..Muhtamad (Pilas) in the last election, with an electoral landslide of over 60,000 votes against her only opponent..This is her third and final term as governor..Mayor Cherry Santos-Akbar likewise won handily in Isabela for a third and final term in that City.
The Hataman block (Liberal Party) - Roxas/Aquino Wing) is led by Mujiv Hataman, elected Regional Governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) in 2013, a close friend and ally of Philippine President Benigno Simeon Aquino III..He is joined by his brother, Rep. Hajiman Hataman-Salliman, Congressman of the Lone District of Basilan, and his wife, Sitti Djalia Turabin-Hataman who won a seat as a Party-list representative in Congress, representing Anak Mindanao Party-list..They are joined by a number of clan members who likewise won local positions, especially in their bailiwick of Sumisip Municipality in Basilan..The Hatamans can boast of a mixed bag of electoral victories and defeats since 2004..Mujiv Hataman is in his first term as Regional Governor of ARMM, Cong..Jim Salliman is on his second term as Representative, and Cong..Sitti Djalia Hataman is on her first.
The Salapuddin block (Lakas-CMD/Kampi) is led by Abdulgani ""Gerry"" Salapuddin, three-term governor, three-term congressman and two-term Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives..To him, the 2007, 2010 and 2013 elections proved to be a débâcle, as he and his daughter - Rabia Salapuddin (who ran for governor in 2013) lost on all fronts..The Salapuddins have lost all elections since 2007.
The Akbars and Hatamans forged a political alliance in 2012, paving the way for the appointment of Mujiv Hataman to the top post at the ARMM..The criminal case against Hataman was voluntarily dropped by the Akbars in 2012, while the Supreme Court threw out the case filed against Salapuddin in 2013..Both Akbar and Hataman coalitions are currently affiliated with the Liberal Party of the Philippines, led by President Aquino..Salapuddin has remained with Lakas-CMD.

Recent local elections
As a result of the 2010 Synchronized National and Local Elections, three major factions emerged: the Akbar block, still formidable, albeit splintered and severely weakened from within after the assassination of clan patriarch, Rep. Wahab Akbar, of the Administration Lakas-Kampi-CMD; the Hataman block, suddenly a potent force to be reckoned with province-wide, under the new administration's Liberal Party; and a third force headed by former Akbar ally and Ungkaya Pukan Mayor Joel T. Maturan, of the Nacionalista Party and former Lakas-CMD stalwart Salapuddin.
Slain Congressman Wahab Akbar's first wife Jum Jainuddin-Akbar casting her vote during the May 2007 elections.
Incumbent governor Hja..Jum Jainuddin-Akbar won the gubernatorial race, defeating Mujiv Hataman, with Ungkaya Pukan Mayor and former Akbar ally Joel T. Maturan trailing far behind..The lone congressional district of Basilan, on the other hand, was won by Hajiman Salliman Hataman (LP), who had been defeated by Wahab Akbar in 2007, followed closely by former Deputy Speaker Abdulghani Salapuddin (NP), Lantawan Mayor and Wahab Akbar's niece, Tahira Ismael-Sansawi (PMP), Maluso Mayor Sakib Salajin (Lakas-Kampi-CMD), also a nephew of Wahab Akbar and Rajam M. Akbar, Wahab Akbar's sister.
In the cities, incumbents Cherrylyn Santos-Akbar (Lakas-Kampi-CMD) of Isabela and Roderick Furigay (LDP) of Lamitan both won their respective contests..Isabela City's vice mayoral race proved to be hotly contested, with Tabuk Barangay Chairman Abdulbaki Ajibon winning over the incumbent in a close fight..Lamitan's incumbent Vice Mayor Arleigh Eisma ran unopposed.
The election season once again witnessed a spike in crime, most noticeably a rise in kidnappings, assassinations and ambuscades..On January 29, 2009, at 5:00pm, Al Barka Mayor Karam Jakilan was felled in an ambush, together with two of his personal bodyguards..Earlier, a slew of assassinations in both the Akbar and Hataman camps, most prominently an Akbar henchman and two Hataman cousins, commenced early in 2008..Also, a spate of kidnaps for ransom have been widely observed to peak as election season nears.
On April 13, 2010, two bomb blasts rocked Isabela, the first at the Basilan National High School Grandstand Oval, the second right beside Santa Isabel Cathedral..A third controlled explosion was detonated by elements of the Philippine National Police Bomb Squad a few meters from the Isabela City Hall..This was followed by the massacre of twelve residents of Theresa Heights Subdivision, Barangay Eastside, as the bombers, purportedly members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and Abu Sayyaf, escaped from a porous Philippine military cordon.
Local elections have been widely fraught with massive cheating, vote buying and fraud as well..Blame could not be assigned to one particular group or political block alone, as this has been a ""common practice"" across the political spectrum..The May 2010 automated elections turned out to be no different, with Basilan being designated an ""Election Hotspot"" by the Philippines' Election Commission..Violent confrontations between political supporters of rival parties, and the failure of Board of Election Inspectors in two villages in Maluso and Al-Barka Municipalities forced authorities to declare a ""Failure of Elections"" in these parts..Special elections were conducted in these villages on June 3, 2010, where incidents of fraud and minor scuffles were again observed.
May 2013 saw a rematch between the Akbar Block (led by incumbent governor, Jum Jainuddin-Akbar, now affiliated with the administration Liberal Party - LP), against Salapuddin (led by a young Rabia Salapuddin, daughter of former governor and Congressman Abdulgani ""Gerry"" Salapuddin, Lakas-CMD).
In this electoral contest, the Akbars allied with erstwhile political rivals, the Hatamans (led by Mujiv Hataman, who ran as Regional Governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, and his brother, Rep. Jim Hataman-Salliman, Liberal Party), resulting in one of the most lop-sided election landslides in recent memory..Governor Akbar won her re-election bid with a record-breaking 60,000-vote margin against her only challenger, the younger Salapuddin..She is joined by Vice Governor Keemhar Jay Reynon Sakkalahul (LP) who bested a field of five Vice-Gubernatorial contenders..The son of former Basilan Vice Governor Al-Rasheed Sakkalahul, the new Vice Governor is currently the youngest Vice Governor in the Philippines, at 23 years old..Mayor Cherrylyn Santos-Akbar also won another lopsided victory in Isabela City.
The Akbar Block has likewise added two new contenders, the Governor's children - daughter Alfiya Akbar-Fernandez - who topped the Provincial Board Members' tally for District I, while son Al Qaid Akbar managed a third-place debut in local politics as an Isabela City Councilor..The provincial sweep of the Liberal Party was complete in 2013..All winning Provincial Board Members, from Districts 1 and 2 came from the LP, while 11 of 13 Mayors are LP members.
LP ARMM Standard-bearer Mujiv Hataman also won his own contest in the autonomous region - making him the first Basileño to win the region's top post in an election..LP re-electionist Congressman Jim Hataman-Salliman, his brother, likewise reclaimed his seat in Congress..Moreover, Basilan-founded Anak Mindanao Party-list is returned to the House of Representatives, with Mujiv Hataman's wife, Sitti Djalia Turabin Hataman, becoming a Party-list Representative..Elder brother Gulam Hataman is returned unopposed as Sumisip Mayor.

Bellwether Province
In the last five presidential elections, Basilan voted for Ferdinand Edralin Marcos (1965, 1969), Corazon Cojuangco Aquino (1986), Fidel Valdez Ramos (1992), Joseph Ejercito Estrada (1998), and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (2004), all of whom won in their respective bids..Similarly, Basilan's vice presidential choices, namely Fernando Lopez (1969), Salvador Laurel (1986), Joseph Ejercito Estrada (1992), Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (1998) and Noli De Castro (2004), also won, making it one of the most accurate bellwether provinces in Philippine politics today..Sen. Manuel Roxas II was Basilan's Senate top-notcher in 2004, while Sen. Loren Legarda was number one in 2007..The recently conducted May 2010 national/local polls manifested once again Basilan's uncanny record of picking the winners, Benigno S. Aquino III (Liberal Party) and Jejomar C. Binay (PDP-Laban) won in the presidential and vice presidential contests in the Province respectively.
However, Basilan has figured prominently in a number of election-related issues in the past, the foremost being its inclusion among the provinces (together with Cebu and the rest of the ARMM provinces) where, allegedly, former Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo committed wholesale election fraud to win the 2004 presidential elections..The ensuing imbroglio, dubbed the ""Hello Garci"" Scandal, included several mentions of Basilan and its late governor, Wahab Akbar, in taped conversations purportedly between President Arroyo and COMELEC Commissioner Virgilio Garcillano.
Flora and fauna
The island chain is one of two partial land bridges to Borneo and is an important migration route for birds..Among the species of flora and fauna found in Basilan are:

Amphibians
The Basilan Island caecilian (Ichthyophis glandulosus), a species of amphibian in the family Ichthyophiidae..It is endemic to the Philippines.
Birds
The yellow-wattled bulbul (Pycnonotus urostictus), found and documented in the Philippines, specifically Isabela, Basilan, on November 15, 1887, by Moseley, E. L. Published by Steere, J..B. in a list of the birds and mammals collected by the Steere expedition to the Philippines.
The Basilan tarictic hornbill (Penelopides panini basilanicus), a variant of Penelopides affinis basilanicus (Tweeddale, 1877)..Also published by Steere, J..B., in a list of the birds and mammals collected by the Steere expedition to the Philippines.
The Everett's white-eye basilanicus (Zosterops everetti basilanicus), with distribution throughout the Philippines, but more extensively in Basilan, Dinagat, Mindanao, Siargao, and Camiguin..(Everett's white-eye, Tweeddale, 1878)
Plants
The Dipterocarpus basilanicus tree, lofty, emergent, with grayish brown to orange, flaky, prominently lenticellate bark and aromatic oily white resin, with stout buttresses.

Bataan (/bɑːtɑːˈʔɑːn/, /bɑːˈtɑːn/), officially the Province of Bataan (Filipino: Lalawigan ng Bataan IPA: ), is a province in the Central Luzon region of the Philippines..Its capital is the city of Balanga while Mariveles is the largest town in the province..Occupying the entire Bataan Peninsula on Luzon, Bataan is bordered by the provinces of Zambales and Pampanga to the north..The peninsula faces the South China Sea to the west and Subic Bay to the north-west, and encloses Manila Bay to the east.
The Battle of Bataan is known in history as one of the last stands of American and Filipino soldiers before they were overwhelmed by the Japanese forces in World War II..The Bataan Death March was named after the province, where the infamous march started.
History
Aeta peoples
The first inhabitants of the Bataan peninsula are the Ayta Magbeken people..The next group of inhabitants were Kapampangans, who settled east Bataan.
Tagalog migration and states
Later on, Tagalogs from southern Luzon, most specifically Cavite, migrated to parts of Bataan..The Ayta Magbeken migrated towards the mountain areas of Bataan by the end of the 16th century..Kapampangans were displaced to the towns near Pampanga.
Spanish rule
In 1647, Dutch naval forces landed in the country in an attempt to seize the islands from Spain..The Dutch massacred the people of Abucay in Bataan.
Historian Cornelio Bascara documents that the province of Bataan was established on January 11, 1757, by Governor-General Pedro Manuel Arandia out of territories belonging to Pampanga and the corregimiento of Mariveles which, at that time, included Maragondon across Manila Bay..: 31, 54, 113
Japanese invasion
Main article: Battle of Bataan
Further information: Bataan Death March
March 1942: burning houses after a Japanese bombing raid in Bataan
Bataan featured prominently during World War II..Prior to the 1941 Japanese invasion, Bataan was a military reservation for the purpose of defending the fortress island of Corregidor..The US Army stored nearly 1,000,000 US gallons (3,800 m3) of gasoline there, along with various munitions..At the southern tip of the peninsula the U.S. Navy had established a small base at the port of Mariveles.
Shortly after the Japanese Army invaded the country in December 1941, the combined US and Filipino forces were being gradually overrun and General Douglas MacArthur moved his troops to the Bataan Peninsula in an attempt to hold out until a relief force could be sent from the US..Japanese forces started a siege of the peninsula on January 7, 1942, and launched an all-out assault on April 3, a few months after the Battle of the Points, Battle of the Pockets, the attack down Trail Number Two, and a half-dozen other brutal battles.
The majority of the American and Filipino forces surrendered on April 9 and were forced to march more than 100 kilometers (62 mi) from Bataan to Capas, Tarlac, which became known as the Bataan Death March.
Postwar era
Postwar reconstruction in the province of Bataan was generally slow, although there were efforts to pursue industrialization projects in the area, most notably the establishment of the NASSCO (National Shipyard and Steel Corporation) in Mariveles which was inaugurated in 1953 during the Quirino administration.
Marcos dictatorship era
Main articles: Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos, Human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship, and Bataan Nuclear Power Plant
The beginning months of the 1970s marked a period of turmoil and change in the Philippines, as well as in Bataan..: ""43""
Just as this was happening, it was revealed that the site of two communities where the workers of NASSCO lived - Barrio NASSCO and Barrio Camaya - would be torn down for converstion into  the new Bataan Export Processing Zone in 1969, compelling the relocation of the residents who in turn launched protests until the BEPZ was finally built in 1972.
With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president, Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years.
By this time, the social unrest of the pre-martial law period and the Marcos' violent responses to the protests of the time led many of the Philippines' youth, who previously held moderate positions calling for political reform, to be radicalized..Some were convinced to joined the newly-formed New People's Army as a last desperate way to resist Marcos' authoritarianism,
It was also during Martial Law that construction on the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant began in Morong, in 1976.
Contemporary era
On March 14 2020, Bataan recorded one of the earliest cases of COVID-19 infection outside of Metro Manila, with a male patient from Orani being the 64th recorded case in the Philippines.

Batanes, officially the Province of Batanes (Ivatan: Provinsiya nu Batanes; Ilocano: Probinsia ti Batanes; Filipino: Lalawigan ng Batanes, IPA: ), is an archipelagic province in the Philippines, administratively part of the Cagayan Valley region..It is the northernmost province in the Philippines, and the smallest, both in population and land area..The capital is Basco, located on the island of Batan.
The island group is located approximately 162 kilometres (101 mi) north of the Luzon mainland and about 190 kilometres (120 miles) south of Taiwan (Pingtung County), separated from the Babuyan Islands of Cagayan Province by the Balintang Channel, and from Taiwan by the Bashi Channel.
Etymology
The name Batanes is a hispanicised plural form derived from the Ivatan endonym Batan.
History
Early history
The ancestors of today's Ivatans descended from Austronesians who migrated to the islands 4,000 years ago during the Neolithic period..They lived in fortified mountain areas called idjangs and drank sugar-cane wine, or palek..They used gold as currency and were farmers..They were seafarers and boat-builders..Batanes was a major site for the Maritime Jade Road, one of the most extensive sea-based trade networks of a single geological material in the prehistoric world, operating for 3,000 years from 2000 BCE to 1000 CE.
Spanish colonial era
In 1687, the British explorer, privateer, and naturalist William Dampier, known for kidnapping indigenous peoples in the Philippines and selling them as slaves in Europe,
In 1783, the Spanish claimed Batanes as part of the Philippines under the rule of Governor-General José Basco y Vargas..Batanes was ruled as part of the Provincia de Cagayan..The Bashi Channel was increasingly used by English East India Company ships and the Spanish authorities brought the islands under their direct administration to prevent them falling under British control.
Using guns, the Spanish ended the revolution, killing Aman Dangat and several other Ivatan leaders..Basco and Ivana were the first towns established under full Spanish control..Mahatao was then administered by Basco, while Uyugan and Sabtang, by Ivana..Itbayat was not organized until the 1850s, its coast being a ridge..Soon, Ilocanos came to the islands and integrated with the local population.
Roads, ports, bridges, churches and government buildings were built in this time..Limestone technology used by the Spanish spread to the islands, making bridges strong and fortified..Some of these bridges still remain at Ivana and Mahatao..By 1890, many Ivatans were in Manila, and became ilustrados, who then brought home with them the revolutionary ideas of the Katipunan..These Ivatans, who were then discontented with Spanish rule, killed the ruling General Fortea and declared the end of Spanish rule.
American colonial era
Toward the end of the Spanish administration, Batanes was made a part of Cagayan..Due to historical reasons from that time, some segments of Taiwan society argue that the islands should not belong to the Philippines..During the American colonial period, additional public schools were constructed and more Ivatan became aware of their place in the Philippines.
In 1920, the first wireless telegraph was installed, followed by an airfield in 1930..New roads were constructed and the Batanes High School was instituted.
Japanese occupation
Because of their strategic location, the islands was one of the first points occupied by invading Japanese imperial forces at the outbreak of the Pacific War..The morning of December 8, 1941, the Batan Task Force from Taiwan landed on the Batan Islands, which became the first American territory occupied by the Japanese..The purpose of the invasion was to secure the existing small airfield outside Basco, which was accomplished without resistance..Japanese fighters from Basco took part in the raid on Clark Air Base the following day..Over the next several days, the success of the Japanese bombing of Clark Field rendered a base at Basco unnecessary, and on December 10, 1941, the naval combat force was withdrawn to participate in the invasion of Camiguin.
As part of an administrative reorganization, the province of Batanes was downgraded into a municipality of Cagayan from 1942 to 1944..Upon its restoration, Victor de Padua, an Ilocano who was one of the first School Superintendents on Batan was made Provincial Governor..Early in 1945 the island was liberated by the Philippine Commonwealth forces of the 1st and 12th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army.
Philippine independence
Batanes was briefly marred by political violence during the 1969 presidential elections, when the Philippine Constabulary's Special Forces allowed motorcycle-riding goons dubbed the ""Suzuki boys"" to secure the victory of Rufino Antonio Jr., an ally of President Ferdinand Marcos, as representative of the Lone District of Batanes in the House of Representatives of the Philippines through a campaign of terror and intimidation..The resulting outcry led to the Supreme Court decrying the ""rape of democracy"" in the province, and annulled Antonio's victory in 1970 in favor of his rival, Jorge Abad.
In 1984, Pacita Abad, the foremost Ivatan visual artist, became the first woman to be awarded the Ten Outstanding Young Men (TOYM) award, breaking 25 years of male dominance..In her acceptance speech, she said, ""it was long overdue that Filipina women were recognized, as the Philippines was full of outstanding women"" and referred proudly to her mother.
 Vahay ni Dakay Ivatan house, one of the oldest structures in the Batanes islands..The house is made of limestone and coral and its roofing of cogon grass.
In 1993, the Batanes Protected Landscape and Seascape, which encompassed the entire province, was listed in the Tentative List of the Philippines for UNESCO World Heritage Site inscription in the future.
In 1997, the Indigenous Peoples Rights act or IPRA was passed in Philippine Congress..The law paved the way for the indigenous territorial rights of the Ivatans..The province has since promoted its Ivatan roots..Part of the Ilocano population has returned to mainland Luzon..On December 7, 2004, Pacita Abad died after finishing her last international art work while suffering from cancer.
Geography
The province has a total area of 219.01 square kilometres (84.56 sq mi) comprising ten islands situated within the Luzon Strait between the Balintang Channel and Taiwan..The islands are sparsely populated and subject to frequent typhoons..The three largest islands, Batan, Itbayat, and Sabtang, are the only inhabited islands.
The northernmost island in the province, also the northernmost land in the entire Philippines, is Mavulis (or Y'ami) Island..Other islands in the chain are Misanga (or North), Ditarem, Siayan, Diogo (or Dinem), Ivuhos, and Dequey..The islands are part of the Luzon Volcanic Arc.
Topography
Batanes Hills
Almost one-half of Batanes is hills and mountains..Batan Island is generally mountainous on the north and southeast..It has a basin in the interior..Itbayat Island slopes gradually to the west, being mountainous and hilly along its northern, eastern coast..On Sabtang, mountains cover the central part, making the island slope outward to the coast.
The islands are situated between the vast expanse of the waters of Bashi Channel and Balintang Channel, where the Pacific Ocean merges with the China Sea..The area is a sea lane between the Philippines and Japan, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan..It is rich with marine resources, including the rarest sea corals in the world.
The province is hilly and mountainous, with only 1,631.5 hectares or 7.1% of its area level to undulating terrain..78.2% or 17,994.4 hectares vary from rolling hills to steep and very steep..Forty-two percent (42%) or 9,734.40 hectares are steep to very steep land..Because of the terrain of the province, drainage is good and prolonged flooding is non-existent.
The main island of Batan has the largest share of level and nearly level lands, followed by Itbayat and Sabtang, respectively..Itbayat has gently rolling hills and nearly level areas on semi-plateaus surrounded by continuous massive cliffs rising from 20 to 70 metres (66–230 feet) above sea level, with no shorelines..Sabtang has its small flat areas spread sporadically on its coasts, while its interior is dominated by steep mountains and deep canyons..Batan Island and Sabtang have intermittent stretches of sandy beaches and rocky shorelines.
The terrain of the province, while picturesque at almost every turn, has limited the potential for expansion of agriculture in an already very small province.

There is a misconception that Batanes is constantly battered by typhoons.

The population of Batanes in the 2020 census was 18,831 people,..The population density was 86 inhabitants per square kilometre or 220 inhabitants per square mile.

The natives are called Ivatans..They share prehistoric cultural and linguistic commonalities with the Babuyan on Babuyan Island and the Tao people of Orchid Island.
This divided homeland is a result of the Dutch invasion of Taiwan in 1624 (Dutch Formosa) and Spanish invasion in 1626 (Spanish Formosa)..The northern half of the Ivatan homeland, Formosa and Orchid Island were part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain..This area came under Dutch governance..The Dutch were expelled in 1662 by forces of the Chinese Southern Ming dynasty, led by the Chinese pirate Koxinga who then set himself up as The King of Taiwan.
The southern half of the Ivatan homeland, the islands of Batanes, was reinforced and fortified by Spanish refugees from Formosa, before being formally joined in the 18th century with the Spanish government in Manila.
An Ilocano minority population lives in Batanes..Some have left and returned to mainland Luzon.
The main languages spoken in Batanes are Ivatan, which is spoken on the islands of Batan and Sabtang..Itbayaten is spoken primarily on the island of Itbayat..The Ivatan which is dominant in the province is considered to be one of the Austronesian languages..From college level down to elementary level, the language is widely spoken..The  Ivatans widely speak and understand the Ilocano (lingua franca of northern Luzon), Tagalog, and English languages.
Batanes Ilocanos are bilingual in Ilocano and Ivatan..They speak Ilocano with an Ivatan accent.
Ivatan-speaking communities can be found in almost every part of the country, mainly in mainland Luzon and in Bukidnon, Lanao and Cotabato in Mindanao, as well as overseas.
Religion
The large majority (94%) of the island's people adhere to Roman Catholicism..The remaining faiths are other Christian Churches.
Ecology

Flora and fauna
The province is the home of the unique conifer species Podocarpus costalis..Although it is reportedly growing in some other places such as coasts of Luzon, Catanduanes and even Taiwan, full blossoming and fruiting are observed only in Batanes..Its fruiting capacity on the island remains a mystery but is likely due to several factors such as climate, soil and type of substratum of the island.
Several species of birds, bats, reptiles and amphibians inhabit the island..Many of those are endemic to the Philippines..The island is a sanctuary of different migratory birds during winter in the Northern Hemisphere.

About 75% of the Ivatans are farmers and fishermen..The rest are employed in the government and services sector..Garlic and cattle are major cash crops..Ivatans plant camote (sweet potato), cassava, gabi or tuber and a unique variety of white uvi..Sugarcane is raised to produce palek, a kind of native wine, and vinegar.
In recent years, fish catch has declined due to the absence of technical know-how..Employment opportunities are scarce..Most of the educated Ivatans have migrated to urban centers or have gone abroad.
A wind diesel generating plant was commissioned in 2004.
Distance and bad weather work against its economic growth..Certain commodities like rice, soft drinks, and gasoline carry a 75% to 100% mark-up over Manila retail prices.
Transportation
The island province of Batanes is accessible by air, via Basco Airport and Itbayat Airport..There are daily flights from Manila by Philippine Airlines bound to Basco Airport at Batan Island..There are also flights from Tuguegarao City (Cagayan) by Sky Pasada as of 2024..These two airlines make Batan Island accessible from the mainland via air travel..The other local airlines previously serving Basco Airport have stopped their transport services after the COVID 19 Pandemic..As of 2024, PAL Express has flown to Batanes since May 2013..Meanwhile, Itbayat , an island Municipality of the Province of Batanes, is accessible via Basco Airport..There are no direct flights from the mainland to Itbayat..Itbayat may also be accessed via ferry boats from Basco..Meanwhile, Sabtang, also an island municipality like Itbayat, is accesible via ferry boats from Batan Island, particularly from Ivana Port, a Municipality of in the main Island of Batan.
Values
The Ivatan people of Batanes are one of the most egalitarian societies in the Philippines..The prime motivator of the cultural values of the Ivatans are imbibed in their pre-colonial belief systems of respecting nature and all people..The Ivatans, both the older and younger generations, have one of the highest incidences of social acceptance to minority groups in the country.
The Ivatans have a high respect for the elderly and the prowess of natural phenomena such as waves, sea breeze, lightning, thunders, earthquakes, and wildlife congregations..Discriminating someone based on skin color, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, and traditions on nature is unacceptable in Ivatan values..Land grabbing is a grave crime in Ivatan societies, making ancestral domain certification an important part of Ivatan jurisprudence since the enactment of the IPRA Law.
Heritage
This section focuses too much on specific examples without explaining their importance to its main subject..Please help improve this article by citing reliable, secondary sources that evaluate and synthesize these or similar examples within a broader context..(June 2016)
The entire province is listed in the UNESCO tentative list for inscription in the World Heritage List..The government has been finalizing the site's inscription, establishing museums and conservation programs since 2001..Seven intangible heritage elements of the Ivatan have been set by the Philippine government in its initial inventory in 2012..The elements are undergoing a process to be included in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.

Batangas, officially the Province of Batangas (Tagalog: Lalawigan ng Batangas IPA: ), is a first class province of the Philippines located in the southwestern part of Luzon in the Calabarzon region..Its capital is the city of Batangas, and is bordered by the provinces of Cavite and Laguna to the north, and Quezon to the east..Across the Verde Island Passages to the south is the island of Mindoro and to the west lies the South China Sea..Poetically, Batangas is often referred to by its ancient name, Kumintáng.
The province of Batangas was billed as the second richest province in the Philippines by the Commission on Audit by the year 2020..It has been the second richest province in the country for two consecutive years..In 2020, its provincial government posted a record high of ₱25.2 billion worth of assets, the largest in Calabarzon and the whole Luzon.
Batangas is one of the most popular tourist destinations near Metro Manila..It is home to the well-known Taal Volcano, one of the Decade Volcanoes, and the small nearby town of Taal which keeps ancestral houses, churches, and other architecture dating back to the 19th century..The province also has numerous beaches and diving spots including Anilao in Mabini, Sombrero Island in Tingloy, Ligpo Island and Sampaguita Beach in Bauan, Matabungkay in Lian, Punta Fuego in Nasugbu, the municipality of Calatagan, and Laiya in San Juan..All of the marine waters of the province are part of the Verde Island Passage, the center of the world's marine biodiversity.
Batangas City has the second largest international seaport in the Philippines after Metro Manila..The identification of the city as an industrial growth center in the region and being the focal point of the Calabarzon program is seen in the increasing number of business establishments in the city's Central Business District (CBD) as well as numerous industries operating in the province's industrial parks..Lipa City has passed Batangas City as the most populous city in the province.
Etymology
The name Batangas is derived from the term batangan, which has two definitions: a log found in the Calumpang River, and rafts used to fish in Taal Lake.
The Batangas dialect of Tagalog closely resembles the Old Tagalog spoken before the arrival of the Spanish..This is why the Summer Institute of Linguistics calls this province the center of the Tagalog language..The strong presence of Tagalog culture is evident to this day.
Batangas also has one of the highest literacy rates in the country at 96.5%, with men having a slightly higher literacy rate at 97.1% compared to women at 95.9%..The combined average literacy rate is 96%.
Historical precedents
""Kumintang"" redirects here..For the Taiwanese political party, see Kuomintang.
The first recorded name of the province was Kumintáng, whose political center was the present-day municipality (town) of Taal, prior to moving to the municipality of Balayan..Balayan was considered the most progressive town of the region..An eruption of Taal Volcano destroyed a significant portion of the town, causing residents to transfer to Bonbon (now Taal), the name eventually encompassing the bounds of the modern province.
History
Early history
Large centers of population already thrived along the coasts and rivers of present-day Batangas..Barangays lined the Pansipit River draining Bombon Lake (now Taal), a major waterway..The area was a major site for the Maritime Jade Road, one of the most extensive sea-based trade networks of a single geological material in the prehistoric world, operating for ~3,000 years from ~2000 BCE to ~1000 CE..Trading relations with other Philippine peoples, Borneo, Chinese, Japanese, among others were maintained.
Archaeological findings and written accounts by the Spanish explorers in the mid-16th century show that pre-colonial Tagalogs have long histories in complex, stratified societies with trade networks encompassing Southeast and East Asia..This was shown by certain jewelry, made from a chambered nautilus shell, where tiny holes were created by a drill-like tool..The ancient peoples of present-day Batangas were influenced by trade with Indianized states and to a lesser degree China, as shown in many loanwords from Sanskrit and unearthed tradeware ceramics primarily from China and present-day Vietnam and Thailand..A Buddhist image unearthed in Calatagan was reproduced in mould on a clay medallion in bas-relief..According to experts, the image in the pot strongly resembles the iconographic portrayal of Buddha in Siam, India, and Nepal..The pot shows Buddha Amithāba in the tribhanga
One of the major archaeological finds was in January 1941, where two crude stone figures were found in Palapat, also in Calatagan..They were later donated to the National Museum..One of them was destroyed during World War II.
Eighteen years later, a grave was excavated in nearby Punta Buaya..Pieces of brain coral were carved behind the heads of the 12 remains that were found..The site was named Likha (meaning ""create"")..The remains were accompanied by furniture that could be traced as early as the 14th century..Potteries, as well as bracelets, stoneware, and metal objects were also found in the area, suggesting that the people who lived there had extensive contact with people from as far as China.
The presence of dining utensils such as plates or ""chalices"" found with the remains also suggest that prehistoric Batangueños believed in the idea of life-after-death..Thus, the Batangueños, like their neighbors in other parts of Asia, have similar customs of burying furniture with the dead.
Like the nearby tribes, the Batangan or the early Batangueños were a non-aggressive people..Partly because most of the tribes in their immediate environment were related to them by blood..Some weapons Batangans used included the bakyang (bows and arrows), the bangkaw (spears), and the suwan (bolo).
Being highly superstitious, the use of agimat (amulet or talisman) showed that these people believed in the presence of higher beings and other things unseen..The natives believed that forces of nature were a manifestation these higher beings.
The term 'Tagalog' may have been derived from the word taga-ilog or ""river dwellers"" referring to the Pasig River located further up north of the region..However, Wang Teh-Ming in his writings on Sino-Filipino relations points out that Batangas was the real center of the Tagalogs, which he then identified as Ma-yi or Ma-i..According to the Chinese Imperial Annals, Ma-yi had its center in the province and extends to as far as present-day Cavite, Laguna, Rizal, Quezon, Bataan, Bulacan, Mindoro, Marinduque, Nueva Ecija, some parts of Zambales, and Tarlac..However, many historians interchangeably use the term Tagalog and Batangueño.
Henry Otley Beyer, an American archaeologist, also showed in his studies that the early Batangueños had a special affinity with the precious stone known as the jade..He named the Late Paleolithic Period of the Philippines as the Batangas Period in recognition of the multitude of jade found in the excavated caves in the province..Beyer identified that the jade-cult reached the province as early as 800 B.C..and lasted until 200 B.C.
Spanish colonial period
In 1570, Spanish generals Martin de Goiti and Juan de Salcedo explored the coast of Batangas on their way to Manila and came upon a settlement at the mouth of Pansipit River..In 1572, the town of Taal was founded and its convent and stone church were constructed later.
Officially, the Province of Bonbon was founded by Spain in 1578, through Fr..Estaban Ortiz and Fr..Juan de Porras..It was named after the name that was given to it by the Muslim natives who inhabited the area.
In 1581, the Spanish government abolished Bonbon Province and created a new province which came to be known as Balayan Province..The new province was composed of the present provinces of Batangas, Mindoro, Marinduque, southeast Laguna, southeast Quezon, and Camarines..After the devastating eruption of Taal Volcano in 1754, the old town of Taal, present day San Nicolas, was buried..The capital was eventually transferred to Batangas (now a city) for fear of further eruptions where it has remained to date.
In the same years that de Goiti and Salcedo visited the province, the Franciscan missionaries came to Taal, which later became the first Spanish settlement in Batangas and one of the earliest in the Philippines..In 1572, the Augustinians founded Taal in the place of Wawa, now San Nicolas, and from there began preaching in Balayan and in all the big settlements around the lake of Bombon (Taal)..The Augustinians, who were the first missionaries in the diocese, remained until the revolution against Spain..Among the first missionaries were eminent men, which included Alfonso de Albuquerque, Diego Espinas, Juan de Montojo, and others.
During the first ten years, the whole region around the Lake of Bombon was completely Christianized..It was done through the preaching of men who had learned the first rudiments of the language of the people..At the same time, they started writing manuals of devotion in Tagalog, such as novenas, and had written the first Tagalog grammar that served other missionaries who came.
Foundation of important parishes followed throughout the years: 1572, the Taal Parish was founded by the Augustinians; 1581, the Batangas Parish under Fray Diego Mexica; 1596, Bauan Parish administered by the Augustinian missionaries; 1605, Lipa Parish under the Augustinian administration; 1774, Balayan Parish was founded; By the end of the 1700s, Batangas had 15,014 native families and 451 Spanish Filipino families;: 31, 54, 113  1852, Nasugbu Parish was established; and 1868, Lemery Parish too.
The town of Nasugbu became an important centre of trade during the Spanish occupation of the country..It was the site of the first recorded battle between two European Forces in Asia in Fortune Island, Nasugbu, Batangas..In the late part of the 20th century, the inhabitants of Fortune Island discovered a sunken galleon that contained materials sold in the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade.
Batangas was also among the first of the eight Philippine provinces to revolt against Spain and one of the provinces placed under Martial Law by Spanish Governor-General Ramon Blanco on August 30, 1896..This event was given distinction when Marcela Agoncillo, also a native of the province, made the Philippine Flag, which bears a sun with eight rays to represent these eight provinces.
American invasion era
Map of Batangas in 1918
When the Americans forbade the Philippine flag from being flown anywhere in the country, Batangas was one of the places where the revolutionaries chose to propagate their propaganda..Many, especially the revolutionary artists, chose Batangas as the place to perform their plays..In an incident recorded by Amelia Bonifacio in her diary, the performance of Tanikalang Ginto in the province led not only to the arrest of the company but all of the audience..Later, the play was banned from being shown anywhere in the country.
General Miguel Malvar is recognized as the last Filipino general to surrender to the United States in the Philippine–American War.
Japanese occupation era
After the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the Japanese sent their planes to attack the Philippines, launching major air raids throughout the country..The bombings resulted in the destruction of the Batangas Airport located in Batangas City, of which nothing remains today.
When Gen. Douglas MacArthur ordered the overall retreat of the American-Filipino Forces to Bataan in 1942, the province was ultimately abandoned and later came under direct Japanese occupation..During this time, the Imperial Japanese Army committed many crimes against civilians including the massacre of 328 people in Bauan, 320 in Taal, 300 in Cuenca, 107 in San Jose, and 39 in Lucero.
Liberation
XIV Corps of 158th RCT, 11th Airborne Division and 1st Cavalry Division campaign in Batangas and nearby province.
As part of the Philippines Campaign (1944–45), the province's liberation began on January 31, 1945, when elements of the 11th Airborne Division, part of the U.S. Eighth Army went ashore at Nasugbu, Batangas..However, Batangas was not the main objective of the invasion force..Instead, most of its units headed north to capture Manila, and by March 3, the capital was completely secured.
Liberation of Batangas proper by American forces began in March 1945 by the 11th Airborne Division and the 158th Regimental Combat Team (RCT).
Afterwards, the 158th RCT turned northward to meet the Japanese Fuji Force defenses at Mt..Maculot in Cuenca on March 19..The 158th disengaged from the Japanese on March 23 and were relieved by the 11th Airborne's 187th Glider Infantry Regiment..Another 11th Airborne Division task force, the 188th Infantry was ordered to dispatch troops around Batangas City and its remaining frontiers.
Lipa after being Liberated by the Allied Forces
The last major offensive for the capture of the Lipa Corridor began when 188th Infantry Task Force from Batangas City left for Lipa on March 24.
The 188th Infantry met stiff resistance from Fuji Force's 86th Airfield Battalion on March 26..To the north, the 1st Cavalry attacked the remaining Japanese defenses in the towns of Santo Tomas and Tanauan and succeeded in linking up with the advancing 187th and 188th task forces from the south.
With the capture of Lipa and Mt..Malepunyo, organized resistance ended in the province..Some elements of the 188th Infantry Task Force were left to clear the Batangas mountains located southeast of the province from the remaining Japanese.
Throughout the battle, recognized Filipino guerrilla fighters played an important key role in the advancement of the combined American and Philippine Commonwealth troops, providing key roads and intelligence on the location of Japanese defenses and movements..The 11th Airborne and attached Filipino guerrillas had 390 casualties, of which 90 were killed..The Japanese, however, lost 1,490 men..By the end of April 1945, Batangas was liberated and fully secured under Allied control, thus ending all hostilities.
The movements of the military general headquarters and military camps of the Philippine Commonwealth Army happened from January 3, 1942, to June 30, 1946, and included the province of Batangas..During the engagements of the Anti-Japanese Imperial Military Operations in Manila, southern Luzon, Mindoro, and Palawan from 1942 to 1945, (including the provinces of Rizal, Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Mindoro, and Palawan), units of the Philippine Constabulary, with the local guerrilla resistance joined with the U.S. liberation military forces against the Imperial Japanese armed forces.
Under the Southern Luzon Campaign, local Filipino soldiers of the 4th, 42nd, 43rd, 45th, and 46th Infantry Divisions of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 4th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary joined the battle for the liberation of Batangas.
Philippine independence
After Douglas MacArthur made his famous landing in the Island of Leyte, he came next to the town of Nasugbu to mark the liberation of Luzon..This historic landing is remembered by the people of Batangas every last day of January, a holiday for the Nasugbugueños.
Former official seal of Batangas Province, designed and in use since 1950..It was replaced in 2009 during Vilma Santos's tenure as governor.
After the United States of America relinquished control of the Philippines, statesmen from Batangas featured prominently in the government..These include the legislators Felipe Agoncillo, Galicano Apacible (who later became the Secretary of Agriculture), Ramon Diokno, Apolinario R. Apacible, Expedito Leviste, Gregorio Katigbak, Teodoro Kalaw, Claro M. Recto, and José Laurel, Jr.
It is also notable that when President Manuel L. Quezon left the Philippines during the Japanese Occupation, the Japanese government in the Philippines chose the Batangueño José Laurel, Sr. to be the president of the Japanese-sponsored Second Philippine Republic.
Under the Marcos Presidency
Batangueños were not spared the social and economic turmoil that began during the second term of President Ferdinand Marcos, including his 1971 suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, his 1972 declaration of martial law, and his continued hold on power from the lifting of martial law in 1981 until his ouster under the People Power Revolution of 1986.
Prominent Batangueño Senator Jose W. Diokno was one of the first people Marcos imprisoned without charges,
In 1981, Marcos used his Presidential “power of eminent domain” to convert 167 hectares of agricultural lands in San Rafael, Calaca, for industrial use, paving the way for the construction of the Semirara Calaca power plant regardless of its health and environmental impact.
Among the later victims of the regime were student leaders Ismael Umali, Noel Clarete, and Aurelio Magpantay from Western Philippine Colleges in Batangas City, who disappeared after a protest rally in March 1984, and whose mangled bodies were later discovered abandoned in nearby Cavite province.
Contemporary
After the ouster of Ferdinand Marcos and the creation of the Fifth Philippine Republic, numerous Batanguenos took up prominent positions in government - most prominently Salvador Laurel, who became Vice President of the Philippines under the first Aquino administration, and Renato Corona, who became Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines.

Language
Main article: Batangas Tagalog
The dialect of Tagalog spoken in the province closely resembles the Old Tagalog spoken before the arrival of the Spanish..Hence, the Summer Institute of Linguistics  called this province the heartland of the Tagalog language..A strong presence of the Tagalog culture is visible up to the present day..Many educated Batangueños speak a version of Tagalog from the Spanish colonial era but with English terms, as in modern Filipino or standard Tagalog, because of mass media and modern versions of the Tagalog Bible.
Linguistically, Batangueños are also known for their unique affectation of often placing the particles eh or ga (equivalent to the particle ba in Filipino), usually as a marker of stress on the sentence, at the end of their spoken sentences or speech; for example: ""Ay, oo nga, eh!"".(""Aye, yes, indeed!"")..Some even prolong the particle 'eh' into 'ala eh', though this has no meaning in itself.
English is widely understood in the province..Spanish is also understood to some extent, especially by older-generation people in the towns of Nasugbu, Taal, and Lemery, which still have Spanish-speaking minorities..Bicolano, Kapampangan, Ilocano, Visayan, Maguindanaon, Maranao and Tausug are also spoken by a minority due to the influx of migrants from the Bicol Region, Ilocos Region, Cordillera Administrative Region, Cagayan Valley, Central Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.

Products
Batangas is known for its butterfly knives, locally known as balisong, with its manufacture also becoming an industry in the province.
Agriculture and fisheries
Pineapples are also common in Batangas..Aside from the fruit, the leaves are also useful such that an industry has been created from it..Pineapple leaves fibers are processed to form a silk-like fabric known as piña, from which the barong tagalog, the national costume of the Philippines is made.
Livestock as an industry also thrives in Batangas..The term bakang Batangas (literally ""Batangas cow"") is associated with the country's best species of cattle, and are widely sought throughout the country..Cattle raising is widely practiced in Batangas such that every Saturday is an auction day in the municipalities of San Juan, Bauan and Padre Garcia.
Fishing plays a very important part of the economy of the province..Although the tuna industry in the country is centered in General Santos, Batangas is also known for the smaller species of the said fish..The locals even have their own names for it..Some of them are bigeye tuna (tambakol), yellowfin tuna (berberabe), tambakulis, Pacific bluefin tuna (tulingan), bullet tuna (bonito) and another species also called bonito but actually Gymnosarda unicolor..There is also an important industry for the wahoo (tanigi).
Aside from the South China Sea, Taal Lake also provides a source of freshwater fishes to the country..The lake is home to Sardinella tawilis or simply tawilis, a species of freshwater sardine that is endemic to the lake..Taal Lake also provides farmed Chanos chanos or bangus..There is also a good volume of Oreochromis niloticus niloticus and Oreochromis aureus, both locally called tilapia..It is ecologically important to note that neither bangus nor tilapia are native to the lake, and are considered an invasive species.
Sugar is also a major industry..After Hacienda Luisita, the country's former largest sugar producer, was broken-up for land reform, the municipality of Nasugbu has been the home of the current largest sugar producing company, the Central Azucarera de Don Pedro..Rice cakes and sweets are also a strong industry.
Some towns (those adjacent to Laguna) have a prosperous bamboo based industry, where several houses and furniture are made of bamboo..Natives say that food cooked in bamboo has an added scent and flavor..Labong, or bamboo shoots, is cooked with coconut milk or with other ingredients to make a Batangas delicacy.

The Provincial Capitol of Batangas
With the provinces in the island of Panay, Ilocos Sur and Pampanga, Batangas was one of the earliest provinces established by the Spaniards who settled in the country..It was headed by Martin de Goiti and since then has become one of the most important regions of the Philippines..Batangas first came to be known as Bonbon..It was named after Taal Lake, which was also originally called Bonbon..Some of the earliest settlements in Batangas were established in the vicinity of Taal Lake..In 1534, Batangas became the first practically organized province in Luzon..Balayan was the capital of the province for 135 years from 1597 to 1732..In 1732, it was moved to Taal, then the flourishing and most progressive town in the province, it wasn't until 1754 that the capital was destroyed by the Great Taal Eruption of 1754..It was in 1889 that the capital was moved to the present, Batangas City.

The Cavite-Tagaytay-Batangas (CTBEX) is a proposed expressway from the municipality of Silang, Cavite up to the town of Nasugbu..CTBEX is to connect with the Cavite–Laguna Expressway (CALAEX)..Once opened, this will provide motorists a faster route to the resort towns of Nasugbu, Lian and Calatagan in the western part of the province.
Water transport
Batangas Port, the starting point of the western route of the Western Nautical Highway and also a principal port.
Batangas Port in Batangas City is the principal port for ferry access to Mindoro, Tablas, Romblon, and other islands..Montenegro Lines is the largest of a number of passenger shipping companies operating out of Batangas..Condensate tankers offload at Batangas in sizeable quantity..Batangas Port is expanded in 2008 to house facilities for container ships.
Being an entry point to the rest of the archipelago, Batangas has roll-on/roll-off (RoRo) ferry connections with Mindoro and Visayas..The western portion of the Nautical Highway starts at Batangas, and connects with Calapan, Oriental Mindoro..Batangas Port serves as another principal port, along with the Manila International Port for inter-island and international cargo shipping, as well as interisland passenger shipping.
Electricity
Poles of the Batangas II Electric Cooperative in Lipa..Batangas II Electric Cooperative is one of three major power distribution utilities in Batangas, along with Batangas I Electric Cooperative and Meralco.
Electric power in Batangas is mostly distributed by electric cooperatives, namely the Batangas I Electric Cooperative (BATELEC-I) and Batangas II Electric Cooperative (BATELEC-II)..The former serves the western part of Batangas, like Nasugbu, Calatagan, Balayan, Lemery, and Taal, while the latter serves the eastern part, like Lipa, Tanauan, Talisay, San Jose, and Rosario..The municipalities of Bauan and Ibaan, and LIMA Technology Center are served by local utility companies..Santo Tomas, the First Philippine Industrial Park (FPIP) in Tanauan, San Pascual and Batangas City, however, are served by the Metro Manila-based electric company, Meralco..Some large industrial customers are supplied by the 69,000 volt grid, operated by National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP), BATELEC-II, and Meralco.

Most power plants in Batangas, however, use fossil fuels, such as coal and natural gas, and are the subjects of environmental grievances because of their effects on ecosystems..One power plant to be built at Mabacong, Batangas City, is facing opposition from environmentalists and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lipa, owing to its effect on residents and the aquatic ecosystem on Verde Island Passage.
Culture

Way of life
Maria Kalaw Katigbak, a Filipino historian, was quoted to call the Batangueños the Hybrid-Tagalogs..One particular custom in the Batangas culture is the so-called Matanda sa Dugo (lit..older by blood) practice wherein one expresses respect not because of age but because of consanguinity..During the early times, the custom of having very large families were very common..Thus, a particular person's uncle could be of the same age, or even younger than himself..Because of the custom, the older person would still address the younger one with an honorary title such as tiyo/tio or simply kuya if they can no longer establish the actual relationship or add the honorific ho / po in their sentences when addressing the younger instead of the other way around..This often draws confusion from the other provinces who are not accustomed to such practices..This practice exists until today.
Batangueños are very ""regionalistic""..When one learns that another in the room is also from Batangas, the two would be together until the end of the event..In workplace settings, a Batangueno may also express preference for another Batangueno as long as the workplace regulations allow..Thus, the running joke on the Batangas Mafia.
Batangueños are also known for high-toned conversations that seemingly sound like a heating argument to non-Batangueños but in fact, they are not always the case, as they are just normal conversations.
They also tend to live in a large extended family..It has been observed that a piece of land remains undivided until the family connection becomes too difficult to establish actual blood relations..Marriages between relatives of the fifth generation is still restrained in the Batangan culture even if Philippine laws allow it.
Batangueños have been known for their religious practices, where devotees of the Catholic religion perform rituals such as dances (subli) and chants (luwa/lua) to express their faith..One of these is the ritual called Pasión/Pasyon based on the passion of Jesus Christ in which religious chants are recited during the Lenten season..In May, the people of Bauan and Alitagtag celebrate the feast day of the Mahal na Poon ng Santa Cruz (lit..Lord of the Holy Cross), a ritual dance called the Subli is made to honor the Poon..In the town of Taal, they celebrate the feast day of Our Lady of Caysasay and San Martin de Tours a two-day celebration where a procession begins from the shrine of the Virgin going towards the Pansipit River from which the fluvial procession and another procession towards the Basilica are made in honor of the Virgin Mary..Fiestas in other towns usually start in the month of May and last up to the first day of June, usually the plaza near the church becomes the center of activities.
Mythology and literature
Scholars also identified that the ancient Batangueños, like the rest of the Tagalog tribe, worship the Supreme Creator, known as Bathala..Lesser gods like Mayari, the goddess of the moon and her honorary brother Apolake, god of the sun, were also present..Dambana practices are also present in the province.
For literature, Padre Vicente Garcia came to be known when he wrote an essay to defend José Rizal's Noli Me Tangere.
In 2004, the province of Batangas gave Domingo Landicho (familiarly called Inggo by Batangueños) who was born in the province the Dangal ng Batangas (Pride of Batangas) Award for being the ""Peoples' Poet"".
Music
Further information: Filipino Traditional Music
Musicologists identified Batangas as the origin of the kumintang, an ancient war song, which later evolved to become the signature of Filipino love songs the kundiman..From the ancient kumintang, another vocal music emerged, identified as the awit..The huluna, a psalm-like lullaby, is also famous in some towns, especially Bauan.
During the Lenten Season, the Christian passion-narrative, called Pasyon by the natives, is expected in every corners of the province..In fact according to scholars, the very first printed version of the pasyon was authored by a layman from Rosario named Gaspar Aquino de Belen..Although de Belen's version was printed in 1702, it is still debated whether there were earlier versions.
Debates may also be done while singing..Batangueños are known for the duplo (a sung debate where each line of the verse must be octosyllabic) and the karagatan (a sung debate where each line of the verse must be dodecasyllabic.).The latter, whose literal meaning is ""ocean"", got its name from the opening lines..Always, the karagatan is opened by saying some verses that alludes the depth of the sea and comparing it to the difficulty of joining the debate..And as mentioned above, the debate must be sung.
Batangas is also the origin of the balitao..Aside from being a form of vocal music, the balitao is also a form of dance music..Together with the subli, it is the most famous form of dance native to Batangas.
Architecture and sculpture
Basilica de San Martin in Taal
As shown in its ancient churches, Batangas is home to some of the best preserved colonial architectures in the country, especially evident in the municipality of Taal.
Though not as popular as the carving industry of Paete, Taal is still known for the sculptures engraved in furniture..Sometimes, altar tables coming from Taal were called the ""friars' choice"".
According to Milagros Covarubias-Jamir, another Filipino scholar, the furniture that came from Taal during the colonial times was comparable to equivalent quality furniture from China.

Benguet (IPA: ), officially the Province of Benguet (Ibaloi: Probinsya ne Benguet; Kankanaey: Probinsyan di Benguet; Pangasinan: Luyag/Probinsia na Benguet; Ilocano: Probinsia ti Benguet; Filipino: Lalawigan ng Benguet), is a landlocked province of the Philippines located in the southern tip of the Cordillera Administrative Region in the island of Luzon..Its capital is La Trinidad.
The highland province is known as the Salad Bowl of the Philippines due to its huge production of upland vegetables.
Situated within the interior of Benguet is the highly urbanized city of Baguio, which is administered independent from the province and also its largest city.
History
Early history
The mountainous area now covered by Benguet is generally presumed to have been settled from at least the 14th century by tribes  coming from the surrounding lowlands, lured by the abundance of natural resources such as gold, hides, and wax..Two of these groups, the Ibaloi and the Kankanaey, are dominant ethnolinguistic groups of the area..In the pre-conquest period, these tribes enjoyed flourishing trade with lowland groups immediately to their west and south, such as the Pangasinans..Governor Juan ""Oraa"" Cariño (1913-1918), one of Benguet’s governors, was the first Filipino governor.
The Kankanaey occupied the northern highlands of the province, while the Ibaloy occupied the southern portion, while all Igorots practiced animism and ancestor worship..Rituals were proscribed by the priests, mambunong..The economy of the region was based on rice terraces, root crop swidden farming, livestock raising, hunting, foraging, plus the mining and trading of gold..These Igorot gold mines were located in Suyoc, Tabio, Acupan, and Antamok..Gold panning took place in placer deposits along the Agno River, the Bued River, the Suyoc River, and the Amburayan River..Gold was also mined from lode veins within andesite and diorite..Gold in Mankayan was associated with copper..Gold mining resulted in social stratification, with the upper class consisting of the mine owners, the baknang, followed by the gold workers, or abiteg, and then the bagaen, or slave class..These slaves were made up of war captives, and their children..Gold mines were inheritable kinship property, while original ownership was bestowed on those individuals discovering the gold location, and then developing the property..: 183
Spanish colonial era
At the beginning of the Spanish Era, colonisers heard of the rich gold mines in the mountains and attempted to colonize the highlands, but failed..In 1572, Spanish conquistador Juan de Salcedo led a small expedition into the southern part of Benguet, but the natives forced it to retreat..: 473–475
In the 1800s, Spanish colonizers made more serious attempts such as expeditions under Col. Guillermo Galvey
This area later became a district of the new province of La Montañosa (or La Montaña)
American government era
When the Americans took control of the Philippines, they established local civil governments in many parts of the country..American civilian government was established in Benguet on November 23, 1900, through Act No..48, with Canadian journalist H.P..Whitmarsh appointed as the province's first governor.

When Baguio was converted into a chartered city in 1909, barrio Tuba was separated from the city and incorporated into the township of Twin Peaks.
Upon the American colonial government enacting Act No..1876 on August 18, 1908, which created Mountain Province from areas of the old La Montañosa, Benguet (along with Amburayan, Apayao, Bontoc, Ifugao, Kalinga, and Lepanto) became sub-provinces of this new province.
Mining companies started operating in the province in the 1930s..This brought jobs, and many lowlanders migrated to Benguet, especially in towns surrounding the gold mines, such as Itogon, Mankayan and Tuba.
Japanese occupation era

Contemporary history
On June 18, 1966, the huge Mountain Province was split into four provinces with the enactment of Republic Act No..4695..The four provinces were Benguet, Mountain Province, Kalinga-Apayao and Ifugao.
On June 22, 1973, as part of the Integrated Organization Plan of President Ferdinand Marcos, Benguet was placed under the jurisdiction of the Ilocos Region.
When the Cordillera Administrative Region was established by President Corazon Aquino through Executive Order 220 on July 15, 1987, Benguet was made one of its provinces.
Geology
Dalupirip schist in Itogon, Benguet
Sandstone beds comprising the Zigzag formation as seen along the Bued River, Camp 6, Baguio City
The Baguio Mining District consists of Late Cretaceous ophiolite basement rocks..These are overlain by Eocene back arc tholeiitic Pugo Metavolcanics..These grade into the Dalupirip Schist, which is separated from the Early Oligocene-Early Miocene sedimentary Zigzag Formation by an unconformity..The Zigzag is composed of deep depositional environment interbedded green sandstones, red siltstones, oligomicitc conglomerates, and minor limestone units..The late Early Miocene-early Middle Miocene reefal Kennon Limestone overlays the Zigzag..The Late Oligocene-Early Miocene Agno Batholith intrudes the Pugo and Zigzag..The Middle-Late Miocene Klondyke Formation was deposited during Central Cordillera geologic uplift, consisting of coarse clastics, polymictic conglomerates, sandstones, and vitric (glassy) tuffs, with minor shales and siltstones..Gold mineralization occurred with dioritic and gabbroic intrusions, and basaltic to andesitic lavas, including the Monglo adakite..The Pliocene Baguio Formation consists of conglomerates interbedded with lava flows and pyroclastics..Pleistocene gold-copper mineralization occurred with calc-alkaline and dioritic and dacitic adakitic intrusions..This mineralization characterizes the Philex Mine.
The main gold base metal mineralization zone is approximately 8 km wide, trends north south for tens of kilometers, and is centrally located at 16° 20' to 16° 26' N latitude and 120° 37' 30"" to 120° 43' 30"" E longitude..The western boundary of this zone is defined by a volcanic belt, just west of Baguio, while the eastern boundary is defined by an intrusive belt, just east of the Itogon and Antamok mines..The Agno quartz diorite batholith is further east near Binga Dam..Key mines, starting from the south, include the Philex (Cu), Acupan (Au), Itogon (Au), Black Mt..(Cu), Benguet Exploration (Cu), Atok (Au), Antamok (Cu and Au), and Baguio Gold (Au), where Baguio Gold and Antamok are east of Baguio..Continuing northwards, key mines include the King Solomon (Cu), St. Nino (Cu), Boneng (Cu), Lobo (Cu), Gambang (Cu and Au), and Lepanto (Cu and Au).
By 1979, underground mining had reached Level 1850 in the Antamok Mine.

Biliran, officially the Province of Biliran (Waray-Waray: Probinsya han Biliran; Cebuano: Lalawigan sa Biliran; Tagalog: Lalawigan ng Biliran), is an island province in the Philippines located in the Eastern Visayas region (Region VIII)..Biliran is one of the country's smallest and newest provinces..Formerly a sub-province of Leyte, it became an independent province in 1992.
Biliran lies less than a kilometer north of the island of Leyte..A bridge-causeway fixed link over Poro Island in the gateway town of Biliran connects the province to Leyte..Its capital is the municipality of Naval on the western coast of the island.
Etymology
During the early Spanish era, what is now called Biliran was known as Isla de Panamao..The present name, believed to be adopted sometime between the late 17th century and the early 18th century, was, according to many publications, derived from a native grass called borobiliran which once grew abundantly on the island's plains..A contending theory states that the name came from the word bilir, which was defined in an old Visayan dictionary to be the “corner or edge of a boat, vase or anything protruding, like veins, or the furrow made by the plow.” The dictionary also gives biliran as an alternate spelling for bilir..This theory is supported by the fact that Biliran was site of the first large-scale shipyard, built in the 17th century..Galleons were built to support the Galleon trade between Manila and Acapulco in Mexico.
History
Spanish colonial period
The first town, named Biliran, was founded in 1712 after petitioning for a municipality and parish status..During this time, the island was a part of Cebu Province..Biliran, together with the islands of Samar and Leyte, were constituted into a separate province in 1735..Later when Samar and Leyte were split into two provinces in 1768, Biliran became part of Leyte Province as its sub-province..The first parish priest was assigned in 1765, but its parish status was apparently withdrawn because of Padre Gaspar's apostasy..The parish was re-established on February 22, 1782.
Moro raids
In May 1735, representative inhabitants of Leyte petitioned Governor-General Fernando Valdes y Tamon to allow them to resettle Biliran Island..They claimed it had been abandoned for the past 50 years and was presently inhabited by bagamundos (vagabonds) due to the frequent Moro raids.
On May 26, 1754, Moros destroyed Biliran and the town of Catbalogan in Samar..Panamao was reportedly razed to the ground and only the gobernadorcillo (mayor) of Biliran town escaped capture by the raiders..The old settlements of Caybiran, Mapuyo and Maripipi were also destroyed by the Moros.
The Moros staged their attack by marching inland along the Anas River for a distance of 1.5-2 leguas (leagues)..Having covered part of the interior around a mountain, they managed to capture the inhabitants, with the exception of the gobernadorcillo who escaped..The houses and property of the natives were burned or destroyed..The church building suffered the same fate and its valuables were taken away by the raiders.
Post-Moro invasion
When the Moro raiders were neutralized in the early 19th century, the local inhabitants went into the business of organizing new towns (then called ""pueblos"") in the present geography of Biliran Province.
In 1828, Caibiran on the east became an independent municipality and parish, the second to be created in Biliran Island.
Naval became the third town, carved out of the territory of Biliran town..It first became a separate parish in 1860..The Spanish colonial government officially recognized its municipality status on September 23, 1869, following the petition submitted around 1861.
Almeria became a separate town in 1886 and was named after the City of Almería in Spain.
Maripipi used to be a barrio of Naval..It was officially inaugurated as a town in 1867, two years ahead of its mother town, then folded up and was reduced into a barrio of Almeria, and then became a town again in 1899..Maripipi and the new towns of San Clemente (later Kawayan), Culaba and Esperanza (later Cabucgayan) were created around 1899 by the revolutionary government under President Emilio Aguinaldo.
Japanese occupation era
This section needs expansion..You can help by adding to it..(July 2016)
During the World War II, Biliran had its own guerrilla forces under the Leyte command of Colonel Ruperto Kangleon..The guerrilla operation was of invaluable assistance to the successful landing of the American liberation forces at Palo, Leyte, on October 20, 1944, just before the Battle of Leyte Gulf.
In 1945, Biliran was liberated by the Philippine Commonwealth forces of the 9th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army who landed in Biliran..Aided by the local guerrilla forces, they attacked the Japanese troops on the island during the Battle of Biliran during World War II.
Philippine independence
Provincehood
On April 8, 1959, Republic Act No..2141 was signed into law effectively making Biliran a sub-province of Leyte..The island became an independent province on May 11, 1992, through Republic Act No..7160, making it one of the newest provinces in the country.

Biliran has a total land area of 536.01 square kilometres (206.95 sq mi), making it the fourth smallest province in the Philippines..The island lies off the northern coast of Leyte island across Biliran Strait..To the southeast is Carigara Bay, to the northeast is the Samar Sea, and across this sea is Samar..To the west is the Visayan Sea and Masbate lies 30 kilometres (19 mi) to the northwest..The province is composed of two major volcanic islands: the main island also named Biliran and Maripipi, a smaller island to the northwest..Other smaller islands include Higatangan and Dalutan.
Topography
The main volcanic island of Biliran features mountainous interiors with very narrow coastal areas..Only the municipalities of Naval and Caibiran have wide plains extending about 7 km (4.3 mi) from the coast suitable for agriculture..Mount Suiro, an inactive volcano, is the highest point on Biliran with an elevation of 1,301 m (4,268 ft).
The only known historical volcanic activity at Biliran was a phreatic eruption and possible debris avalanche at a thermal area on September 26, 1939.
Maripipi is a 924-metre (3,031 ft) volcanic island with the Maripipi Volcano located in the center and the Municipality of Maripipi surrounding its shores and lower slopes..The volcano is classified as potentially active but has had no historical eruptions.
Climate
Biliran has a combination of warm and cool climatic zones, thus the prevailing climate is ideal for the cultivation of a wide range of agricultural crops..There is no distinct dry season but the heavy wet season generally occurs in December.

Being mountainous, Biliran can support various agricultural crops..The warm lowlands are conducive to rice (palay) production and other tropical crops..The cool highlands are favorable to high-value crops such as cut flowers and varieties of upland vegetables.
The inhabitants also engage in hunting, lumber, and manufacturing..The principal raw material produced is copra and coconut oil..Processed goods include white clay ceramics, dried fish, raw gulaman, and citronella oil.
The untapped natural resources of the island include geothermal power and the abundant sulfur and gypsum deposits.
Major industries includes fashion bags, Romblon bags, baskets, shellcrafts, placemats, hot pads, beverage coasters and trays.

Bohol (Tagalog pronunciation:
The province of Bohol is a first-class province divided into 3 congressional districts, comprising 1 component city and 47 municipalities.
The province is a popular tourist destination with its beaches and resorts..The Chocolate Hills, numerous mounds of brown-colored limestone formations, are the most popular attraction..The formations can be seen by land (climbing the highest point) or by air via ultralight air tours..Panglao Island, located just southwest of Tagbilaran, is famous for its diving locations and is routinely  listed as one of the top ten diving locations in the world..Numerous tourist resorts and dive centers dot the southern beaches..The Philippine tarsier, among the world's smallest primates, is indigenous to the island.
It was the home province of Carlos P. Garcia, the eighth president of the Republic of the Philippines (1957–1961) who was born in Talibon, Bohol.
On October 15, 2013, Bohol was devastated by a 7.2 magnitude earthquake whose epicenter was 6 km (3.7 mi) south of Sagbayan..The earthquake, which also hit southern Cebu, claimed 222 lives altogether and injured 374 people..It also destroyed or damaged a number of Bohol's heritage churches.
In 2023, Bohol Island was designated as a UNESCO Global Geopark, the first in the Philippines.
Bohol is also the province with the most towns in the Philippines, totalling 47 towns, and 1 component city, Tagbilaran City.
Etymology
Bohol is accordingly derived from the local word bo-ol, a kind of tree that flourished on the island..Similar to Nahuatl, the h in the middle was used to transcribe a glottal stop which is a common phoneme in the languages of the Philippines..The original name survives as Bool, a barangay or village in Tagbilaran City where Miguel Lopez de Legazpi supposedly landed.
History
Early history
Late Metal Age to Protohistoric Period (3,000 B.C.)
The region of Southeastern Bohol, particularly Cogtong Bay in Candijay and the Anda Peninsula are known as the ""cradle of civilization of Bohol"" from archaeological findings of pre-colonial petroglyphs, and ancient bodies from burial sites which were housed in boat-shaped wooden-coffins..Boat coffin burial has been found prevalent in Mindanao, Palawan, Negros, Panay, Maranduque, and Masbate as well as throughout Southeast Asia in Borneo and Vietnam.
Unfortunately, theft and extraction of sacred burial sites of human remains by U.S. universities occurred during the American colonial area, particularly conducted by the University of Michigan and Bucknell University in the 1920s..The University of Michigan has up to 22 human remains taken from Carmen and Mabini, Bohol.

Further information: Kedatuan of Dapitan
A drawing from the Boxer Codex depicting the Pintados.
In the early 17th Century Father Ignacio Alcina, recorded that a certain Datung Sumanga of Leyte wooed the princess, Bugbung Humasanum, of Bohol, and married her after raiding Imperial China and aftwards were the precursors of the people there..The invasion of Bohol by the people of Panglao ushered the Kedatuan of Bohol..The kedatuan prospered under the reign of the two brother rulers of Panglao - Datu Dailisan and Datu Pagbuaya, with trade links established with neighbouring Southeast Asian countries, particularly with the Sultanate of Ternate..The flourishing of trade is owed to its strategic location along the busy trading channels of Cebu and Butuan..For other countries such as Ternate to gain access to the busy trade ports of the Visayas, they need to first forge diplomatic ties with the Bohol ""kingdom"".
Relations between the Sultanate of Ternate and the province of Bohol soured when the Ternatan sultan learned the sad fate of his emissary and his men who were executed by the two ruling chieftains of Bohol as punishment for abusing one of the concubines..Thus, in 1563, the Ternatans attacked Bohol..Twenty joangas deceitfully posing as traders were sent by the sultan of Ternate to attack Bohol.
Bohol is derived from the word Bo-ho or Bo-ol.
Spanish colonial era (1500s to 1890s)
The earliest significant contact of the island with Spain occurred in 1565..On March 25 (March 16 in the Julian calendar), a Spanish explorer named Miguel López de Legazpi arrived in Bohol seeking spices and gold..After convincing the native chieftains that they were not Portuguese (who raided the islands of Mactan in 1521), Legazpi made a peace pact with Datu Sikatuna..This pact was signified with a sandugo (blood compact) between the two men.
Two significant revolts occurred in Bohol during the Spanish Era..One was the Tamblot Uprising in 1621, led by Tamblot, a babaylan..This revolt met with reprisals from the Spanish forces in Cebu, who on January 6, 1635; under orders by Juan de Alcarazo the Alcalde-Mayor of Cebu, a force of 50 Spanish and 1,000 Visayan troops, battled the rebels and settled in Bohol.
The other was the famous Dagohoy Rebellion, considered the longest in Philippine history..This rebellion was led by Francisco Dagohoy, also known as Francisco Sendrijas, from 1744 to 1829.
Politically, Bohol was administered as part of Cebu Province..It was separated from Cebu on July 22, 1854, together with Siquijor..A census in 1879 found Bohol with a population of 253,103 distributed among 34 municipalities.
The culture of the Boholanos was influenced by Spain and Mexico during colonization..Many traditional dances, music, dishes and other aspects of the culture have considerable Hispanic influence.
Philippine-American War: American occupation era (1899-1902)
After the United States defeated Spain in the Spanish–American War, the U.S. bought the entire Philippine islands..However, under the newly proclaimed independent government established by Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo, which was not recognized by the U.S., Bohol was governed as a Gobierno de Canton.
During the resulting Philippine–American War, American troops peacefully took over the island in March 1899.
World War II: Japanese occupation era (1942-1945)
Japanese troops landed in Tagbilaran on May 17, 1942..Boholanos struggled in a guerrilla resistance against the Japanese forces..Bohol was later liberated by the local guerrillas and the Filipino and American troops who landed on April 11, 1945.
A plaque placed on the port of Tagbilaran commemorating the liberation reads:One thousand one hundred seventy two officers and men of the 3rd Battalion of the 164th Infantry Regiment of the Americal Division under the command of Lt. Col. William H. Considine landed at the Tagbilaran Insular Wharf at 7:00 o'clock in the morning of April 11, 1945.
The convoy taking the Filipino and American liberation forces to Bohol consisted of a flotilla of six landing ships (medium), six landing crafts (infantry), two landing crafts (support), and one landing craft (LSM(R))..Upon arrival, the reinforced battalion combat team advanced rapidly to the east and northeast with the mission of destroying all hostile forces in Bohol..Motor patrols were immediately dispatched by Col. Considine, Task Force Commander, and combed the area to the north and east, approximately halfway across the island, but no enemies were found during the reconnaissance..Finally, an enemy group of undetermined strength was located to the north of Ginopolan in Valencia, near the Sierra-Bullones boundary.
By April 17 the Task Force was poised to strike in Ginopolan..The bulk of the Japanese force was destroyed and beaten in the ten days of action..Bohol was officially declared liberated on May 25, 1945, by Major General William H. Arnold, Commander of the Americal Division..About this time, most officers and men of the Bohol Area Command had been processed by units of the Eighth United States Army.
On May 31, 1945, the Bohol Area Command was officially deactivated upon orders of Lt. General Robert L. Eichelberger, Commanding General of the Eighth United States Army, together with the regular and constable troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, Philippine Constabulary, and the Boholano guerrillas.
During the Second Battle of Bohol from March to August 1945, Filipino troops of the 3rd, 8th, 83rd, 85th and 86th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 8th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary captured and liberated the island province of Bohol and helped the Boholano guerrilla fighters and U.S. liberation forces defeat the Japanese Imperial forces under General Sōsaku Suzuki.

Garcia, who had been born in Talibon, succeeded to the presidency..He won a full term in the 1957 presidential election..He ran for a second full term as president in the 1961 presidential election and was defeated by Vice President Diosdado Macapagal.
In 1965 after a number of attempts to convert Tagbilaran into a City, the three Congressmen of Bohol sponsored the Bill to which would become Republic ACt 4660, creating the City Charter of Tagbilaran on June 18, 1966.
Marcos dictatorship Era
Main articles: Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos, Human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship, and Economic history of the Philippines during the Marcos dictatorship
The Philippines' gradual postwar recovery took a turn for the worse in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis being one of the early landmark events.
In Bohol, which had been marked by agricultural self-sufficiency
In 1972, one year before the expected end of his last constitutionally allowed term as president in 1973, Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law.
During this time Camp Dagohoy in Tagbilaran functioned as one of many detention centers during the Marcos dictatorship, under the ambit of Regional Command for Detainees III (RECAD III) at Camp Lapu-Lapu in Cebu City..Among whose detainees of Camp Dagohoy was the 19-year old brother of Judge Meinrado Paredes, who was beaten with firearms so that he eventually suffered permanent damage to his hearing.
The immediate government response to the NPA presence was an integrated ""social, economic, cultural and political"" program which also saw the deployment of a ""Special Action Force"" to the island in 1985, but conflict continued and even intensified through the 1980s and 1990s.

Geography
Satellite image of the island of Bohol
The Chocolate Hills of Bohol
To the west of Bohol is Cebu, to the northeast is the island of Leyte and to the south, across the Bohol Sea, is Mindanao..The Cebu Strait separates Bohol from Cebu, and both island provinces share a common language, but Boholano retains a conscious distinction from Cebuano..Bohol's climate is generally dry, with maximum rainfall between the months of June and October..The interior is cooler than the coast.
Physical features
With a land area of 4,821 km2 (1,861 sq mi) and a coastline 261 km (162 mi) long, Bohol is the tenth largest island of the Philippines..The main island is surrounded by about 70 smaller islands, the largest of which are Panglao Island, facing Tagbilaran, in the southwest and Lapinig Island in the northeast.
The terrain of Bohol is basically rolling and hilly, and about half the island is covered in limestone..Near the outer areas of the island are low mountain ranges..The interior is a large plateau with irregular landforms.
Near Carmen, the Chocolate Hills are more than 1,200 uniformly cone-shaped hills named for the grass growing on the hills that turns brown in the summer, making the landscape look like chocolate mounds..They are hills made of limestone left over from coral reefs during the Ice Age when the island was submerged..The Chocolate Hills are considered one of Philippine's natural wonders and Bohol is often referred to as the Jewel of the Philippines..They appear on the provincial seal of Bohol.
Bohol has 114 springs, 172 creeks, and four main rivers that run through Bohol with a radial drainage pattern.
Numerous waterfalls and caves are scattered across the island, including Mag‑Aso Falls in Antequera..Mag‑Aso means smoke in the native tongue..The water is cool and often creates a mist in humid mornings which can hide the falls.
The Rajah Sikatuna Protected Landscape protects Bohol's largest remaining lowland forest and can be found in the island's southern portion near Bilar.

Tarsier
In 1996 the Philippine Tarsier Foundation was established in Corella, Bohol in efforts to help conserve and protect tarsiers and their habitat..Forest and habitat sanctuaries have been created to ensure the safety of tarsiers while allowing visitors to roam and discover these miniature primates in their natural habitats.
The tarsier is the smallest living primate and exists in several Southeast Asian countries today..The Philippine tarsier, Tarsius syrichta, locally known as ""mamag"" in Boholano is near to threatened according to the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species.
Climate
From November to April, the northeast monsoon (amihan) prevails..Except for a rare shower, this is the mildest time of the year..Daytime temperatures average 28 °C (82 °F), cooling at night to around 25 °C (77 °F)..The summer season from May to July brings higher temperatures and very humid days..From August to October is the southwest monsoon (habagat)..The weather during this season is not very predictable, with weeks of calm weather alternating with rainy days..It can rain any day of the year, but a higher chance of heavy showers occurs from November to January.
Geologic formation

The formation of the island of Bohol began during the Late Jurassic Period (about 160 to 145 million years ago)..It was still submerged except for what is now Mt..Malibalibod in Ubay and its adjacent area in Alicia, Bohol..Approximately 66 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous Period, the northern portion of the island began to rise gradually..Volcanic activity during the time caused the deposition of numerous layers of volcanic rock in the region..Land mass increased and grew at the beginning of the Paleogene Period (about 60 million years ago)..During this period, diorite, a form of igneous rock, was introduced into the Talibon area..Between the Eocene and Oligocene epochs, the island's development was halted for millions of years..At the beginning of the Miocene epoch (about 23 million years ago), the island's geologic evolution continued..The combination of uplift and volcanism resulted in the deposition of limestone and the expulsion of andesite, a form of volcanic rock..Only the eastern half of the island was above water during this time..Approximately 5 million years ago, the southeastern portion of the island began to emerge from the ocean..From the late Pliocene to the Pleistocene (approximately 3.6 to 1.8 million years ago), the rest of the once-submerged portion of the island of Bohol rose to the surface, giving the island its present form.

Bukidnon (/buːˈkɪdnɒn/), officially the Province of Bukidnon (Cebuano: Lalawigan sa Bukidnon; Filipino: Lalawigan ng Bukidnon; Hiligaynon: Kapuroan sang Bukidnon; Binukid and Higaonon: Probinsya ta Bukidnon), is a landlocked province in the Philippines located in the Northern Mindanao region.
The province is composed of 2 component cities and 20 municipalities..It is the third largest province in the country in terms of total area of jurisdiction behind Palawan and Isabela respectively.
The name ""Bukidnon"" means ""highlander"" or ""mountain dweller."".Occupying a wide plateau in the north central part of the island of Mindanao, the province is considered to be the food basket of the region, being the major producer of rice and corn..Products from plantations in the province also include pineapples, bananas and sugarcane.
Situated within Bukidnon is Mount Dulang-dulang, the 2nd highest mountain in the country, with an elevation of 2,938 metres (9,639 ft) located in the Kitanglad Mountain Range.
Bukidnon was consecutively ranked 5th in the list of richest provinces in the Philippines for four straight years according to the Commission on Audit's 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Annual Financial Reports which were posted in 2019, early to late 2021, and 2022, respectively.
History
Early history
One of the ""tulugan"" at Kaamulan Park, Malaybalay
According to oral history of the Indigenous people of Bukidnon, there were four main tribes in Central Mindanao: the Maranaos who dwell in Lanao del Sur, and the Maguindanao, Manobo and Talaandig tribes who respectively inhabit the eastern, southern, and north-central portions of the original province of Cotabato..When the civil government divided central Mindanao into provinces at the turn of the 20th century, the groups included in the province of Bukidnon are the Talaandig and the Manobo, as well as other smaller Lumad tribes..The Visayans, particularly the Cebuanos and the Hiligaynons from the Northern Mindanao coastline and the southern Visayas, migrated into the province..The Visayans are still referred to by the Lumad as the dumagat (""sea people"") to distinguish them from the original mountain tribes..This was followed by various groups from Luzon, namely, the Ilocanos, the Igorots and the Ivatans, many of whom were merchants and wealthy entrepreneurs..All contributed massive acculturation among the Indigenous tribes..Most of those who moved to the mountains and forest continued to hold on their ancestors' cultural heritage..The wide variety of Filipino groups now thrives in the province and contributed immensely in the socioeconomic development.
Spanish colonial era
Bukidnon Provincial Capitol, Malaybalay
Bukidnon became a part of Misamis in the latter part of 1850..The whole area was then called ""Malaybalay"" and the people were known as Bukidnons (highlanders or mountain dwellers).
American invasion era
The Philippine Commission, then headed by Commissioner Dean C. Worcester, Secretary of Interior, proposed the separation of Bukidnon from Misamis Province..On August 20, 1907, the Philippine Commission Act No..1693 was enacted the Province of Agusan and sub-province of Bukidnon..Bukidnon became a regular province on March 10, 1917, by virtue of the creation of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu under Act 2711.
Japanese occupation era
In 1942, invading Japanese troops entered Bukidnon..Mount Capistrano was a civilian evacuation area in the World War II..In 1945, the province was liberated from Japanese occupation by Filipino and American troops with the aid of Bukidnon-based Filipino guerrillas during the Second World War.
Geography
Bukidnon is a landlocked plateau in North Central Mindanao..It is bounded on the north by Misamis Oriental and Cagayan de Oro; on the south by North Cotabato and Davao City; on the east by Agusan del Sur and Davao del Norte; and west by Lanao del Sur..It lies between parallels 7°25' and 8°38' north latitude and meridians 124°03' and 125°16' east longitude..Malaybalay, the capital town, is about 850 kilometers (530 mi) by air from Manila and 91 kilometers (57 mi) by road from Cagayan de Oro.
It has two important landmarks, Mount Kitanglad and Pulangi River..Mount Kitanglad has a peak of 2,899 meters (9,511 ft) above sea level..Pulangi River, on the other hand, traverses through the northeastern and southern part of the province towards the Rio Grande de Mindanao.
Land area
The province's total land area is 10,498.59 square kilometres (4,053.53 sq mi),10,498.59 making it the largest in Mindanao in terms of land area..It accounts for 59 percent (59%) of Northern Mindanao..Thirty-eight percent (38%) is classified as alienable and disposable..The rest is timberland forest.
It also accounts for 80 percent (80%) or 34 million metric tons of the region's nonmetallic mineral deposits, which include high grade white and red clay, gold, chromite, copper, serpentine, manganese, quartz and limestone deposits can also be found in the province.
Topography
Mangima Canyon at Maluko, Manolo Fortich..Also located in the town is a canyon near barangay Lunocan, dubbed as the ""Grand Canyon of the Philippines"".
Much of Bukidnon is an extensive plateau, but the southern and eastern boundaries are mountainous..The province's average elevation is 915 meters (3,002 ft) above sea level..The slope gradient peaks at 2,899 meters (9,511 ft) of Mount Kitanglad, an extinct volcano occupying the central portion..Two other mountain bodies are found in its southern portion, Mount Kalatungan and Mount Tangkulan, which rise to 2,287 meters (7,503 ft) and 1,678 meters (5,505 ft), respectively..The rest of the province is composed of nearly level terraces, alluvial plains, canyons and gorges..The volcanic terraces and volcanic foot slopes that are ≥500 m above sea level are estimated to be about 221,600 hectares (548,000 acres).
Gently rolling grassland plateau are cut by deep and wide canyons of the Cagayan, Pulangi, and Tagoloan rivers and their tributaries, which cover a greater part of the province..The Bukidnon plateau is mainly of volcanic zone consisting of pyroclastic, basaltic and andesitic cones.
View from Musuan Peak of the Maapag Plain of central Bukidnon..The foothills of the Kalatungan Mountain Range is visible on the upper right.
The whole eastern and southern border adjoining the provinces of Agusan, Davao del Norte, and Cotabato are covered by lofty and densely forested Pantaron Mountain Range, also known as the Central Cordillera..The Central Cordillera is a mountain range of sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous rocks..About 49% of the land resource of the province is of rugged hills and mountains and 33% of undulating to rolling terrain.
At Mailag, 23 kilometers (14 mi) south of Malaybalay, the plateau begins to descend and gradually merges into the lowlands of Cotabato province.
Climate
Two types of climate are roughly divided by the northern and southern areas of Bukidnon..The northern part is classified as belonging to Type III, that is, there is no pronounced rain period but relatively dry during the months of November to May..In the southern portion of the province, the climate is classified as Type IV with no dry season..The driest area is Baungon, while the wettest is the Calabugao plain..The climate is relatively cool and humid throughout the year.
The average annual rainfall is 2,800 millimeters (110 in)..Just like in other parts of the country, rainfall is more pronounced from June to October compared to other months of the year..February to April are the drier months.
Temperature ranges vary with elevation..In areas lower than 500 meters (1,600 ft) above sea level (m.a.s.l..), the recorded temperature range is between 20 and 34 °C (68 and 93 °F)..Areas with elevations greater than 500 meters (1,600 ft) above sea level would have temperatures ranging from 18 to 28 °C (64 to 82 °F).
Relative humidity also varies with elevation, with those above 500 m having relative humidity of about 80%, while areas lying below 500 meters (1,600 ft), 65-7 percent..Thus, the Malaybalay-Impasugong area and those around the volcanic cones approximate semi-temperate conditions and can support the cultivation of highland tropical crops.
Based on the records of climatological stations within and near the province, lithology and land form, three agro-ecological zones are identified..One covers the mountainous eastern side (Central Cordillera), which is generally wet, with rainfall of about 2,340 to 4,000 millimeters (92 to 157 in) per annum..Another covers the high altitude volcanic plains, the Malaybalay-Impasug-ong area, and the foot slopes of Mount Kitanglad, and Mount Kalatungan..These areas have an annual rainfall in the range of 2,490 to 3,680 millimeters (98 to 145 in)..The third zone covers the south-central and the north-western parts of the province, with elevations of less than 500 meters, relatively dry with mean annual rainfall in the range of 1,700 to 2,600 millimeters (67 to 102 in).

Rivers
Bukidnon is home to the largest concentration of watersheds in Mindanao..It is endowed with six major river systems, namely: Pulangi, Tagoloan, Cagayan, Manupali, Muleta, and Bobonawan rivers..These rivers and their tributaries carved the landscape of the province, creating numerous canyons into the plateau.
The Pulangi River, considered the longest river in the province, is a tributary of the Rio Grande de Mindanao..Its headwaters are found in the mountains of Kalabugao, Impasugong..It is the largest as well as the longest river found in the province..It covers the following cities and municipalities of the province: Impasugong, Malaybalay, Cabanglasan, San Fernando, Valencia, Maramag, Quezon, Don Carlos, Kitaotao, Dangcagan, Kibawe and Damulog.
The Tagoloan River has its headwaters in the mountains of Can-ayan, Malaybalay..It traverses the province northwestward passing through Malaybalay, Impasugong, Sumilao, Manolo Fortich, Malitbog and finally empties into the sea at Tagoloan, Misamis Oriental.
The Pulangi River winding through the Maapag Plain in Valencia City
The Cagayan River watershed is found mostly in the municipality of Talakag..Its headwaters are found in the Kitanglad Mountain Range in central Bukidnon..The river flows northward through the municipalities of Talakag and Baungon..Its mouth lies at Cagayan de Oro in Misamis Oriental, where it is the main source of potable water.
The Manupali River, a major tributary of the Pulangi River, starts in the mountains of Lantapan, Bukidnon, picking up tributaries along the way from the Kalatungan and Kitanglad Mountain Ranges..It forms part of the natural boundary of the Valencia and Lantapan..It flows eastward towards Malaybalay, eventually joining the Pulangi River in Valencia.

Binaki, a type of steamed corn cake wrapped with corn husks is believed to have originated in Bukidnon
Bukidnon is an agricultural economy..It is a major producer of rice, maize, sugar, coffee, rubber, pineapple, banana, tomato, flowers, cassava, and other fruits and vegetables..Almost all large firms operating in the province are into production or processing of these agricultural products..Recognized by the Food and Agriculture Organization as a foot-and-mouth disease-free province, it is also a major producer of poultry, hogs, goats, and cattle.
The Philippine Carabao Center's outlet in Central Mindanao University makes dairy products from water buffalos..Due to being landlocked, Bukidnon relies on the nearby cities of Cagayan de Oro and Davao for the supply of marine products..However, the province has its own supply of freshwater products such as tilapia, carp, catfish, mudfish, gourami, barb, goby, climbing perch, freshwater eels, giant freshwater prawn or shrimps, native freshwater snails or freshwater clams, and freshwater crabs, either via inland fishing or fry production aquaculture in inland fish farms and fish hatcheries.

Bukidnon Investment Grid
During the mid-1990s, the provincial government of Bukidnon, after careful studies and consultation, has adopted a strategic program called the Bukidnon Investment Grid or BIG..This program is aimed to confine all its investment promotion activities and projects to the strip of land three kilometers from both sides of the Sayre Highway from Damulog to Manolo Fortich, and along the national/provincial road from Kibawe to Kadingilan; Don Carlos to Kadingilan; Maramag to Quezon; Maramag to Kadingilan; Kadingilan to Pangantucan; Valencia City to San Fernando; Malaybalay City to Cabanglasan; Malaybalay to Lantapan; Manolo Fortich to Libona; Libona to Cagayan de Oro; Talakag to Pangantucan; and Malitbog to Tagoloan in Misamis Oriental.
Transportation
The province is very well accessible by road primarily from the cities of Cagayan de Oro and Davao with alternate road networks as well from the cities of Butuan (via Agusan del Sur), Iligan (via Talakag), Marawi (via Talakag), Tagum (via San Fernando), and the province of Cotabato.
Sayre Highway in Malaybalay City
The entire province is bisected from north to south by the four-lane Sayre Highway from Cagayan de Oro to Kabacan, North Cotabato via Maramag (Bukidnon–Cotabato Road); and by the two-to-four lane Bukidnon–Davao Road (colloquially known as ""BuDa"") from Quezon to Davao City..Both are components of National Route 10 (N10) of the Philippine highway network, and a spur of the Asian Highway 26 (AH26) of the Asian highway network..The Sayre Highway intersects with the BuDa Road in the barrio of Dologon in Maramag, where it changes to route N943 and continues on to Dangcagan, Damulog, and Kabacan.
The Sayre Highway (formerly ""Route 3"") was renamed in honor of Francis Bowes Sayre, Sr., the U.S. Philippine High Commissioner who spearheaded its construction during the American occupation of the Philippines.
There are several airstrips in the province being used by private firms..Commercial flights used to be flown from the Malaybalay Airstrip, but it was closed down by the provincial government in the late 1990s..The airport where it used to be located was converted into a low-cost housing project..A proposed domestic airport site in the municipality of Don Carlos has already been on the talks since 2008 and in 2013, the Bukidnon Airport Development Project proposal was finalized..There are no seaports in Bukidnon because the province is landlocked..The nearest passenger seaport is in Cagayan de Oro.

Festivals
A Kaamulan float
The province celebrates the Kaamulan Festival, an ethnic cultural festival held annually in Malaybalay, Bukidnon from the mid-February up to March 10, the founding date of the Bukidnon as a province in 1917..It is held to celebrate the culture and tradition of the seven ethnic tribal groups—Bukidnon, Higaonon, Talaandig, Manobo, Matigsalug, Tigwahanon, and Umayamnon—that originally inhabit the province..Kaamulan comes from the indigenous Binukid word amul meaning ""to gather""..Kaamulan is gathering for a purpose—a datuship ritual, a wedding ceremony, a thanksgiving festival during harvest time, a peace pact, or all of these together..The festival started in 1974 and is celebrated until now..It is the only authentic ethnic festival in the Philippines.

Official English- version:Bukidnon My Home
Unofficial Cebuano Version:Bukidnon Matahum
Bisan pa hindu a
Lalag ku'g uli a
Dini ta Bukidnun
Kanak ha banuwa
Buntud ha matangkaw,
Kalasan...makupal,
Patag ha malu-ag,
Ha tungkay madagway.
Chorus:
Bunturan,  balalayan
Basakan, kapatagan
Pastuhan, kapinyahan
Alan-alan kauyagan
Langit din piglambungan
Pig-aldawan kalamagan
Singenem uranan
Alan-alan kaayaran
Wherever I may roam
The distant lands to see
I long to go back home
To sweet Bukidnon home
Her lovely mountains high
Her forests old and grand
Bring memories to me
The home I long to see.
Chorus:
There my heart, yearns to be
In far away, Bukidnon land.
Under its blue starry sky,
Where love and joy never die.
(Repeat Chorus)
Bisan asa kita
Sa hakayong dapit
Mobalik gihapon
sa atong Bukidnon
Nindot ang Kabukiran
Lunhaw'ng Kalasangan
Tam-is palandungon
Yuta ko'ng matahum
KORUS:
Dughan ko nagahandum
Sa yuta ko nga Bukidnon
May Kahayag ug Kalinaw
Gugma'g kalipay sa kanunay
(Balik KORUS)

Main article: History of BulacanThe First Constitutional Democracy in Asia was proclaimed in 1899 at the Barasoain Church in Malolos City, the capital of Bulacan.
Bulacan is also the birthplace of the famous men and women of the country, like Marcelo H. del Pilar, known as ""The Great Propagandist"", and General Gregorio del Pilar who is famed as ""The Tirad Pass Hero"".
The poet Francisco Balagtas, the singer Nicanor Abelardo, and the sculptor Guillermo Tolentino are some notable artists from Bulacan.
Spanish colonial period
The conquest of the area comprising present-day Bulacan traces to the first years of the Spanish in the Philippines..Upon the defeat of the Macabebe and Hagonoy forces led by Bambalito in the Battle of Bangkusay on June 3, 1571, Martín de Goiti to proceeded north, first to Lubao in September 1571.
Two months later, on November 14, 1571, Goiti reached Malolos and Calumpit, respectively, and it was reported to Adelantado Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, the first Governor-General of the Philippines..Adelantado established Calumpit and Malolos as an encomienda entrusted to Sargento Juan Moron (Morones in other documents) and Don Marcos de Herrera..These two conquistadores were one of the first group of conquerors accompanied by Legaspi who have arrived in the Islands in 1565.
On April 5, 1572, the encomiendas of Calumpit and Malolos were unified and co-administered by Moron and Herrera..Also in that year, Alcaldia de Calumpit was formed in which the areas of Macabebe, Candaba, Apalit in Pampanga, and the settlements of Meyto, Panducot, Meysulao, and Malolos..On December 28, 1575, Governor-General Francisco Sande ordered to include Hagonoy in Calumpit.
In 1575, Bulakan was established as a visita of Tondo, and it is not part of Calumpit as the boundary between Tondo and Calumpit was marked in Mambog River and placed the statue of Our Lady of Visitacion (patroness of Calumpit) was erected..It was gone and recreated in 1997 upon the re-establishment of the Roman Catholic Parish of Our Lady of Presentacion in Malolos.
On April 30, 1578, the town of Bulakan was officially established by the Augustinians, with Fray Diego Vivar as its first prior, and the convent was dedicated to San Agustin; when this was changed to Our Lady of Assumption is uncertain..It was reported that the western part of present-day Bulacan was to be very well-populated and rich..There is no documentation of the exact year and date when the Alcaldia de Calumpit was dissolved nor of the exact foundation year of the province of Bulacan..It has only been documented that Malolos (then part of Calumpit in 1572) was first to appear as part of Alcaldia de Bulacan in 1582..It may be assumed that the reorganization of encomiendas occurred between 1580 and 1582 at the time of Governor-General Gonzalo Ronquillo de Peñalosa.
The same document, also from the 1582 Relacion de las Islas Filipinas by Miguel de Loarca, reports that Alcaldia de Calumpit had jurisdiction in the areas of Calumpit (the capital), Capalangan, Cabangbangan and Hagonoy, which made up the Alcaldia's villages..Then Loarca mentioned that Alcaldia de Bulacan had Bulakan (its capital), Malolos, Caluya, Guguinto, Binto and Catanghalan (instead of Meycauayan) as its encomiendas, which formerly had one alcalde (mayor), though Loarca wrote that Alcaldia de Bulacan was formed in 1580 at the time of Peñalosa.
Accrding to the document of Governor-General Luis Pérez Dasmariñas in the Account of the Encomiendas for the King of Spain furnished on June 21, 1591, the Alcaldia of Bulacan was part of La Pampanga with the Encomiendas subject to it such as the Encomiendas of Malolos (3,600 persons), Binto (2,000 persons), Guiguinto (2,000 persons), Caluya (2,800 persons), Mecabayan (2,800 persons) and Bulacan identified as "" capital"" and residence of ""alcalde mayor"" with 4,800 persons..In the same 1591 document, it was mentioned that ""Calumpit y Hagonoy"" belonged to Juan Moron with 12,800 persons, 2 Augustinian Convents, and 1 Alcalde Mayor of its own.
However, the establishment and development of the southern part of present-day Bulacan were not simultaneous and identified with the West..In 1578, the Order of Friars Minor, headed by Juan de Plasencia and Diego Oropesa, arrived in the area called Toril (now part of Meycauayan) and their headquarters..Also in 1578, Plasencia established the Town of Meycauayan..Its pueblos were first only settlements of the Old Meycauayan, founded by Franciscan
The province of Bulacan is on the island of Luzon and is one of the most important Alcadias de Termino..Civilly and politically it corresponds to the Audiencia y capitanía general de Filipinas and spiritually belongs to the Archbishop of Manila.
The Casa Real de Malolos..Served as the office and residency of the Governor of Malolos.
During the General Visitation of October 5, 1762, by Don Simón de Anda y Salazar, the province was headed by Capitan Don Jose Pasarin, alcalde mayor of the province.
In the same year, British occupation of Manila happened, and many Tagalog refugees from Manila & north areas of Cavite escaped to Bulacan and to neighboring Nueva Ecija, where the original Kapampangan settlers welcomed them..Bulacan, along with Nueva Ecija, was natively Kapampangan when Spaniards arrived..Majority of Kapampangans sold their lands to the newly-arrived Tagalog settlers and others intermarried with and assimilated to the Tagalog, which made Bulacan dominantly Tagalog.
In 1774, authorities from Bulacan, Tondo, Laguna Bay, and other areas surrounding Manila reported with consternation that discharged soldiers and deserters (from Mexico, Spain and Peru) were providing Indios military training for the weapons that had been disseminated all over the territory during the British war.
By the end of the 1700s, Bulacan had 16,586 native families and 2,007 Spanish Filipino families..: 31, 54, 113
According to the ""Guia de 1839"", Bulacan province on the island of Luzon, Philippines, was governed by a mayor and consisted of 19 pueblos, 36,394 tributes and 181,970 souls.
In 1848, when the boundaries of Pampanga were changed, the region, which includes the important town of San Miguel de Mayumo and neighboring places that were formerly part of Pampanga, was adjudicated to Bulacan.
The Philippine Revolution
Opening of the Malolos Congress (1898)
In an earlier period during 1890, Malolos was a hot spot of Liberal Ilustrados, notably the ""20 Women of Malolos"", who exerted pressure for education under Filipino professors..However, the first phase of the revolution ceased in 1897 with the signing of the Pact of Biak-na-Bato in San Miguel..Under its terms, the leaders of the revolution were to go to Hong Kong and reside there..Under the illusory peace created by the pact, the end of 1897 saw greater determination on the part of the Filipinos to carry on the revolutionary struggle.
In early 1898, the provinces of Zambales, Ilocos, Pampanga, Bulacan, Laguna, Pangasinan, Nueva Ecija, Tarlac, and Camarines rose again..In Central Luzon, a revolutionary government was organized under General Francisco Macabulos, a Kapampangan revolutionary leader of La Paz, Tarlac.
Pandi was, in 1896-97, with the ""Kakarong Republic"", the early epicenter of revolutionary fevor..Despite its defeat in the Battle of Kakarong de Sili, the memory of the Kakarong defenders still remain as part of the history and heritage of Bulacan as the first organized revolutionary government established in the era of the Revolution.
American occupation period
The Americans established a local Philippine government in the Philippines when they held the first municipal election in the country in Baliwag on May 6, 1899..At the beginning of the American rule, 1899–1900, Malolos became the headquarters of the Military Governor of the Philippines at Casa Real..On February 27, 1901, the Philippine Commission officially transferred the seat of government to Malolos, and the Casa Real de Malolos was the seat of the Provincial Governor from 1900 to 1930 until the completion of the capitol building at Guinhawa, Malolos.
Japanese occupation period
In 1942, at the height of World War II, the Japanese Imperial Army occupied Bulacan and made Casa Real de Malolos its headquarters..In 1945, combined Filipino and American forces and local guerrillas attacked the Japanese Imperial Forces and liberated Bulacan.
After the war, Bulacan was embroiled in the rebellion of Hukbalahap Guerrillas.
In February 1945, Huk Squadron 77 composed of 109 veteran guerillas was surrounded, shot, and buried in a mass grave in Malolos, Bulacan.
Marcos dictatorship era
The beginning months of the 1970s marked a period of turmoil and change in the Philippines, as well as in Bulacan..: ""43""
With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president, Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years.
By this time, the social unrest of the pre-martial law period and the Marcos' violent responses to the protests of the time led many of the Philippines' youth, who previously held moderate positions calling for political reform, to be radicalized..Some were convinced to joined the newly-formed New People's Army as a last desperate way to resist Marcos' authoritarianism.
Move of Valenzuela to Metro Manila
Through Presidential Decree № 824, Bulacan was partitioned on November 7, 1975, to form the National Capital Region..The municipality of Valenzuela was excised to form the new region, while the other 25 towns remained in Bulacan.
Issues concerning the foundation date
To determine the tentative date of Bulacan's foundation and to trace its roots from colonial period, efforts and research conducted by Jaime Veneracion, Reynaldo Naguit of the Center for Bulacan Studies, and Isagani Giron of the Samahang Pangkasaysayan ng Bulacan (Sampaka) shows that Bulacan was identified as a visita of Tondo in 1578.
With regards to exact date of foundation of Bulacan as a province, Veneracion correlated it with the practice of Spaniard of dedicating the founding a pueblo to the feast of a patron saint..In the case of Bulacan it is the Nuestra Señora de la Asuncion, which is also the patron saint of Bulakan town, the first capital of the province.
Geography
Bulacan covers a total area of 2,796.10 square kilometers (1,079.58 sq mi) occupying the southeastern section of the Central Luzon region..The province is bounded by Nueva Ecija (San Isidro, Gapan, General Tinio) on the north, Aurora (Dingalan) on the northeast, Quezon (General Nakar) on the east, Rizal (Rodriguez) on the southeast, Metro Manila (Valenzuela City, Malabon, Navotas, Caloocan and Quezon City) on the south, Manila Bay on the southwest, and Pampanga (Candaba, San Luis, Apalit, Macabebe, Masantol) on the west.
Several rivers irrigate the province of Bulacan; the largest one is that of Angat..Angat River passes through the towns of Norzagaray, Angat, Bustos, San Rafael, Baliwag, Plaridel, Pulilan, and Calumpit..It flows thence into the Pampanga River, goes out again, washes Hagonoy, and loses itself in the mangroves..The banks of these rivers are very fertile and are covered with trees.
Terrain
Bulacan lies in the southern portion of the fertile plains of Central Luzon..The area is drained by the Angat and Pampanga rivers..The Sierra Madre mountain range forms the highlands of Bulacan in the east and is a protected area known as the Angat Watershed Forest Reserve..Angat Lake, which was formed by the Angat Dam is located in that area..The highest point in the province at 1,206 meters (3,957 ft) is Mount Oriod, part of the Sierra Madre.
 The Sierra Madre Mountain Range as seen near Mount Oriod's summit
On January 19, 2008, an 18-hectare (44-acre) dump site, a new landfill that would also be a tourist attraction opened in Norzagaray..Ramon Angelo Jr., president Waste Custodian Management Corp. stated: ""I want them to see our system in our place which should not be abhorred because we are using the new state-of-the-art technology.""
Climate
November to April is generally dry while wet for the rest of the year..The northeast monsoon (amihan) prevails from October to January bringing in moderated and light rains..From February to April, the east trade winds predominate but the Sierra Madre (Philippines) mountain range to the east disrupts the winds resulting to a dry period..From May to September, the southwest monsoon (habagat).
The hottest month is May with an average temperature of 29.7 °C (85.5 °F) while the coldest is February with an average temperature of 25.1 °C (77.2 °F).

Cagayan (/kɑːɡəˈjɑːn/ kah-gə-YAHN), officially the Province of Cagayan (Ilocano: Probinsia ti Cagayan; Ibanag: Provinsiya na Cagayan; Itawit: Provinsiya ya Cagayan; Filipino: Lalawigan ng Cagayan), is a province in the Philippines located in the Cagayan Valley region, covering the northeastern tip of Luzon..Its capital is the city of Tuguegarao..It is about 431 kilometres (268 mi) northwest of Manila, and includes the Babuyan Islands to the north..The province borders Ilocos Norte and Apayao to the west, and Kalinga and Isabela to the south.
Cagayan was one of the early provinces that existed during the Spanish colonial period..Called La Provincia de Cagayan, its borders essentially covered the entire Cagayan Valley, which included the present provinces of Isabela, Quirino, Nueva Vizcaya, Batanes and portions of Kalinga, Apayao, and Aurora..The former capital was Nueva Segovia, which also served as the seat of the Diocese of Nueva Segovia..remain of the former vastness of the province..The entire region, however, is still referred to as Cagayan Valley.
Etymology
A folk legend holds that the name was originally derived from the tagay, a plant that grows abundantly in the northern part of the province..The term Catagayan, ""the place where the tagay grows"" was shortened to Cagayan.
History
Early history
Cagayan has a prehistoric civilization with rich and diverse culture..According to archaeologists, the earliest man in the Philippines probably lived in Cagayan thousands
In the classical era, Gattaran and Lal-lo was the home of hunter-gatherers who specialized in hunting mollusks..These hunter-gatherers have stockpiled their leftover mollusk shells in numerous sites in Gattaran and Lal-lo, until eventually, the shells formed into the largest stock of shell-midden sites in the entire Philippines.
The Atta or Negritos were the first people in valley..They were later moved to the uplands or variably assimilated by the Austronesians, from whom the Ibanags, Itawes, Yogads, Gaddangs, Irayas and Malawegs descended - who actually came from one ethnicity..These are the people found by the Spaniards in the different villages along the rivers all over Cagayan..The Spaniards rightly judged that these various villagers came from a single racial stock and decided to make the Ibanag language the lingua franca, both civilly and ecclesiastically for the entire people of Cagayan which they called collectively as the Cagayanes which later was transliterated to become Cagayanos.
Cagayan was a major site for the Maritime Jade Road, one of the most extensive sea-based trade networks of a single geological material in the prehistoric world, operating for 3,000 years from 2000 BCE to 1000 CE.
Even before the Spaniards came to Cagayan, the Cagayanos have already made contact with various civilizations like the Chinese, Japanese and even Indians, as evidenced by various artifacts and even the presence of minor to moderate foreign linguistic elements in the languages of the natives.
Various other peoples, mainly the Ilocanos, Pangasinenses, Kapampangans and Tagalogs, as well as Visayans, Moros and even foreigners like the Chinese, Indians, Arabs, Spaniards and others were further infused to the native Cagayanes to become the modern Cagayano that we know today.
The north coast was also the site of a Wokou state when the Japanese pirate-lord Tay Fusa set up his stronghold there before its destruction during the 1582 Cagayan battles.
Spanish colonial era
In 1581, Captain Juan Pablo Carreon arrived in Cagayan with a hundred fully equipped soldiers and their families by order of Gonzalo Ronquillo de Peñaloza, the fourth Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines..The expeditionary force was sent to explore the Cagayan Valley, to convert the natives to Catholicism, and to establish ecclesiastical missions and towns throughout the valley.
On June 29, 1583, Spanish conquistador Juan de Salcedo traced the northern coastline of Luzon and set foot on the Massi (Pamplona), Tular, and Aparri areas.
La Provincia de Cagayan
In 1583, through a Spanish Royal Decree, the entire northeastern portion of Luzon (specifically, all territories east of the Cordillera mountains and those north of the Caraballo mountains) including the islands in the Balintang Channel were organized into one large political unit called the La Provincia de Cagayan..The provincia's territorial delineation encompassed the present provinces of Batanes, Isabela, Quirino, Nueva Vizcaya, including portions of Kalinga, Apayao, and Aurora..Its capital was Nueva Segovia (the present municipality of Lal-lo).
The Spanish friars soon established mission posts in Camalaniugan and Lal-lo (Nueva Segovia), which became the seat of the Diocese established by Pope Clement VIII on August 14, 1595.
A founding population of 200 Spanish citizens from Europe accompanied by 100 soldiers set up settlements across Cagayan Valley..: 31, 54, 113
The see was moved in 1758 to Vigan because of its relative distance..The Spanish influence can still be seen in the massive churches and other buildings.
In 1839, Nueva Vizcaya was established as a politico-military province and was separated from Cagayan..Later, Isabela was founded as a separate province on May 1, 1856, its areas carved from southern Cagayan and eastern Nueva Vizcaya territories.
During the late 18th century, the New Spain government encouraged the expansion of trade and development of commodity crops..Among these was tobacco, and lands in Cagayan became the center of a vertically integrated monopoly: tobacco was grown there and shipped to Manila, where it was processed and made into cigarettes and cigars..The development of the related bureaucracy and accounting systems was done under the leadership of José de Gálvez, who as visitor-general to Mexico from 1765 to 1772 developed the monopoly there and increased revenues to the Crown..He worked in the Philippines as Minister of the Indies from 1776 to 1787, constructing a similar monopoly there under Governor-General Basco y Vargas (1778–1787).
The establishment of the civil government of Cagayan through the 1583 Spanish Royal Decree is commemorated in the annual Aggao Nac Cagayan celebrations of the Provincial Government of Cagayan and its people.

American era
When the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1898, ending the Spanish–American War, the United States took over the Philippines..It influenced the culture, most notably in agriculture and education, as well as in public works and communications..A naval base also increased interaction between local Filipinos and American sailors and administrators..At the close of the 18th century, there were 29 municipalities in the province of Cagayan..After the Philippines came under American sovereignty in 1902, more municipalities were founded..Since then, due to centralization and shifting of populations, the number of municipalities is back to 29..A new wave of immigration began in the late 19th and 20th centuries with the arrival of another group of the Ilocano settlers who came in large numbers..They now constitute the largest group in the province, and it was only in this large-scale Ilocano immigration & settlement that made Ilocano language replaced Ibanag as the lingua franca of the province.
Japanese occupation
This section needs expansion..You can help by adding to it..(November 2015)
During the Second World War, with air raids by Japanese fighters and bombers, the province of Cagayan suffered much destruction by bombing and later invasion..Japanese Imperial forces entered Cagayan in 1942..While under the Japanese Occupation, several pre-war infantry divisions and regular units of the Philippine Commonwealth Army were re-established during the period on January 3, 1942, to June 30, 1946..They established general headquarters, camps and garrisoned troops in the province of Cagayan, and began operations against the Japanese Occupation forces in the Cagayan Valley..This included sending troops to the provinces of Cagayan and Isabela, and helping the local soldiers of the 11th and 14th Infantry Regiment of the USAFIP-NL, the local guerrilla fighters and the U.S. liberation forces..They fought against the Japanese Imperial forces from 1942 to 1945.
The Battle off Cape Engaño on October 26, 1944, was held off Cape Engaño..At that time American carrier forces attacked the Japanese Northern Force..This became the concluding action of the Battle of Leyte Gulf..The Japanese lost 4 carriers, 3 light cruisers and 9 destroyers.
In 1945, the combined United States and Philippine troops, together with the recognized guerrillas, took Cagayan..Part of the action were the Filipino soldiers of the 11th and 14th Infantry Regiment, Philippine Commonwealth Army, USAFIP-NL liberated the province of Cagayan during the Second World War.

Postwar Era
After World War II Baldomero Perez of Tuguegarao was temporarily appointed as Governor of Cagayan by the Philippine Civil Affairs Unit, serving until he was replaced by Peregrino R. Quinto in 1946.
During the Marcos dictatorship
Main articles: Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos and Human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship
Beginning in the 1970s, Cagayan became known as a bailiwick of Juan Ponce Enrile of Gonzaga, who as Secretary and later Minister of National Defense became one of the most powerful figures during the Martial Law period under President Ferdinand Marcos..His influence enabled the construction of Port Irene, a modernized international harbor facility in Santa Ana that was named after Marcos' daughter Irene, which later formed the basis for the creation of the Cagayan Special Economic Zone and Freeport, whose enabling law was authored by Enrile as a Senator in 1995 and now includes Santa Ana and parts of Aparri.
Loan-funded government spending to promote Ferdinand Marcos’ 1969 reelection campaign caused
With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years.
During that time, logging concessions were awarded in the province by the Marcoses to Enrile and other cronies, leading to the severe degradation of forest cover in the province that contributed to widespread flooding and other environmental issues that persist today.
During the People Power revolution
Main articles: 1986 Philippine presidential election, People Power Revolution, and Provisional Government of the Philippines (1986–1987)
Cagayan saw incidents of political violence during the 1986 Philippine presidential election, including the fatal shooting by militiamen of opposition leader Euginio Coloma in the municipality of Buguey.
A number of Cagayanon politicians played parts in the People Power Revolution two weeks after the election, and in the following one year in which the Philippines was under an  interim provisional revolutionary government between 1986 and 1987..This included Enrile, whose failed

Hotel Delfino siege
Main article: 1990 Hotel Delfino siege
Cagayan was also the site of the Hotel Delfino Siege in Tuguegarao, which took place on March 4, 1990, when efforts to arrest suspended governor Rodolfo Aguinaldo for supporting rebellions against the government of President Corazon Aquino led to him storming the provincial capitol and taking hostages including his would-be arresting officer, Brigadier General Oscar Florendo of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Civil Relations Service..The stand-off deteriorated into a series of gun-battles throughout the town, with Florendo being killed presumably in a crossfire inside the hotel and Aguinaldo managing to escape and go into hiding before later surrendering and being cleared of legal charges by winning reelection in 1992..He was later elected congressman in 1998 but was assassinated by the New People's Army in 2001.
2020 Ulysses Flood
Further information: Typhoon Vamco
Cagayan has been heavily impacted by changing weather pattern changes resulting from climate change,
In November 2020, Typhoon Vamco (locally known in the Philippines as Typhoon Ulysses) crossed the country, dams from all around Luzon neared their spilling points, forcing them to release large amounts of water into their impounds including Magat Dam..The dam opened all of its 7 gates at 24 metres (79 ft), releasing over 5,037 cubic metres (1,331,000 US gal) of water into the Cagayan River flooding numerous riverside towns..Waters under the Buntun Bridge went up as high as 13 metres (43 ft), flooding the nearby barangays up to the roofs of houses.
Because there was very little media coverage of the flooding in the area in the wake of the COVID-19 lockdown in Luzon and the Shutdown of ABS-CBN broadcasting earlier that year,

The population of Cagayan in the 2020 census was 1,268,603 people, with a density of 140 inhabitants per square kilometre or 360 inhabitants per square mile.
The majority of people living in Cagayan are of Ilocano descent, mostly from migrants coming from the Ilocos Region..Originally, the more numerous groups were the Ibanags, who were first sighted by the Spanish explorers and converted to Christianity by missionaries, the reason why the Ibanag language had spread throughout the valley region prior to the arrival of the migrating Ilocanos..Cagayan is predominantly Roman Catholic with 85% of the population affiliated and the Aglipayan Church has a very strong minority in the province.The increasing numbers of the Iglesia Ni Cristo .
Aside from Ilocanos and Ibanags, Malawegs, Itawits, Gaddangs, groups of nomadic Aetas, as well as families of Ibatans who have assimilated into the Ibanag-Ilocano culture make Cagayan their home..More recently, a new group from the south, the Muslim Filipinos, have migrated to this province and have made a community for themselves..In addition to this, Tagalog-speaking peoples from Central Luzon and Southern Luzon have also settled in the area, as well as a few Pangasinans and Kapampangans from the central plains, and Cebuanos and Hiligaynons from Visayas and Mindanao.

Major languages spoken are Ilocano followed by Ibanag, Yogad and Gaddang..Ilocanos and Ibanags speak Ilocano with an Ibanag accent, as descendants of Ilocanos from first generation in Cagayan who lived within Ibanag population learned Ibanag; same situation with Ilocano tinged by Gaddang, Paranan, Yogad, and Itawis accents when descendants of Ilocanos from first generation in Cagayan who lived within Gaddang, Paranan, Yogad, and Itawis populations learned their languages..People especially in the capital and commercial centers speak and understand English and Tagalog/Filipino..Tagalogs, Ilocanos, and Ibanags speak Tagalog with an Ibanag accent, as descendants of Tagalogs from first generation in Cagayan who lived within Ibanag population learned Ibanag..Languages not native in the province are also spoken there such as Maranao, Maguindanaon, Tausug, Pangasinan, Kapampangan, Cebuano and Hiligaynon to varying degrees by their respective ethnic communities within the province.
Endangered languages
There are two endangered indigenous languages in Cagayan..These are the Dupaninan Agta language (with fewer than 1400 remaining speakers) and the Central Cagayan Agta language (with fewer than 799 remaining speakers); both of these are listed as Vulnerable according to the UNESCO Atlas of the World's Endangered Languages..All remaining speakers of the languages are among the community's elders..Without a municipality-wide teaching mechanism of the two endangered languages for the youth where the languages are present, the languages may be extinct within 3-5 decades, making them languages in grave peril unless a teaching-mechanism is established by either the government or an educational institution in the municipalities of Gattaran and Baggao.

Camarines Norte (Central Bikol: Amihanan na Camarines; Filipino: Hilagang Camarines), officially the Province of Camarines Norte (Bikol: Probinsya kan Amihanan na Camarines (Camarines Norte); Tagalog: Lalawigan ng Hilagang Camarines (Camarines Norte)), is a province in the Philippines located in the Bicol Region in Luzon..Its capital is Daet..The province borders Quezon to the west, Camarines Sur to the south, and the Philippine Sea to the north..It has historically been a Bikol-speaking region..However, there has been a language shift in recent years to Tagalog, which is more commonly used nowadays.
History
Spanish colonial era
Spanish conquistador Juan de Salcedo, dispatched by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi to explore the island in 1571, influenced the existence of Camarines Norte..After subduing Taytay and Cainta, he marched further across Laguna and Tayabas..He visited the rich gold-laden town of Mambulao and Paracale, obsessed by them about which he heard from natives there of existing gold mines.
In 1573, Bicol province was founded..From Bicol, the province of Camarines was created in 1636, which was divided in 1829, creating Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur.
When Camarines Norte was separated from Ambos Camarines in 1829, it was assigned the towns of Daet, as capital, Talisay, Indan (now Vinzons), Labo, Paracale, Mambulao (now Jose Panganiban), Capalonga, Ragay, Lupi and Sipocot.
Seventeen years later, it lost Sipocot, Lupi and Ragay to Camarines Sur in exchange for the town of Siruma.
Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur provinces were briefly merged from 1854 to 1857 into Ambos Camarines (ambos is Spanish for ""both"")..In 1858, these provinces were separated and were merged into Ambos Camarines once again in 1893.
When Francisco de Sande took over from Legazpi as governor general, Spanish influence started to be felt in the region..He established a permanent Spanish garrison in Naga to control the region and defend it from Chinese and Muslim pirates..Capt..Pedro de Chavez was assigned to head this force.
Native settlements, which include Mambulao and Paracale, were already thriving when the Spaniards arrived..Indan and Daet were the other settlements besides Capalonga..But Paracale remained the most sought after because of its gold mines.
The towns were chiefly inhabited by Tagalogs; the rests were of Visayan strain..However, most of the immigrants were from Mauban, Quezon..The Spanish missionaries established missions to Christianize the natives.
Daet revolt
From April 14–17, 1898, local members of the Katipunan led by Ildefonso Moreno and other patriots staged an uprising against the Spanish authorities here who have fortified themselves in the house of one Florencio Arana, a Spanish merchant and a long time resident of Daet..Sporadic encounters started on April 14 until April 16 when the rebels occupied Daet and surrounded the Spaniards in the house of Arana..But the Katipuneros failed to repulse the reinforcements which arrived in Barra (now Mercedes) from Nueva Caceres on April 17..Said reinforcements broke the siege of Daet..This resulted in the death and/or execution of many patriots, including Ildefonso Moreno, Tomas Zaldua and his two sons, Jose Abaño, Domingo Lozada and Aniceto Gregorio, among others..While the Daet revolt collapsed, it signaled the start of a series of rebellion throughout the Bicol region.
American era
Map of Camarines Norte in 1918
During the American era, Ambos Camarines province was divided into Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur once again in 1917.
By virtue of Act 2809 of March 3, 1919, Governor General F. B. Harrison separated Camarines Norte from Camarines Sur with the installation of Don Miguel R. Lukban as its first governor..""In functional sense, April 15, 1920, was the date of the organization of Camarines Norte, as directed by Executive Order No..22 dated March 20, 1920, in conformity with the provisions of Act No..2809,"" according to Serafin D. Quiason, former chairman of the National Historical Institute (NHI).
Japanese occupation era
The first guerrilla encounter in the Philippines during the second world war in the Pacific occurred on December 18, 1941 – 11 days after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on Dec. 7, 1941 and 10 days after the attack on Clark Airbase in Pampanga on Dec. 8, 1941 - at Laniton, Basud, Camarines Norte when the Vinzons guerrilla group with some elements of USAFFE units engaged the vanguard of the Japanese Imperial Army advancing towards Daet, the capital town..A shrine was put up in Laniton to mark this historic feat of arms while surviving veterans and the sons and daughters of veterans who fell commemorate this event every Dec. 18 in Basud and Daet under the auspices of the Veterans Federation of the Philippines – Camarines Norte Chapter (VFP-CN), Basud Municipal Government and the Provincial Government.
The general headquarters of Philippine Commonwealth Army started their operations on January 3, 1942..The Philippine Constabulary in Camarines Norte was then established on October 28, 1944..When the U.S. liberation forces returned to the province in 1945, they helped the local Filipino troops and Bicolano guerrillas in the liberation from the Japanese Imperial forces.
Philippine independence
Under the Marcos dictatorship
Main article: Daet massacre
See also: Human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship
On the evening of September 23, 1972, President Ferdinand Marcos announced on television that he had placed the Philippines, including Camarines Norte, under martial law.
On June 14, 1982 Marcos administration forces opened fire on protesters from different barrios, who were marching to demand an increase in copra prices, and to denounce ""fake elections"" and Cocofed..Four people died on the spot, and at least 50 were injured..Two of those who were seriously wounded died two months later.

Early history
The earliest settlers in Camarines Sur are the Isarog Agta people who live within the circumference of Mount Isarog and the Iraya Agta who live within the circumference of Mount Iraya..They have been in the province for thousands of years and have been one of the first settlers in the entire Philippines.
Spanish colonial era
In July 1569, Luis Enríquez de Guzmán, a member of the expedition led by Maestro de Campo Mateo de Saz and Captain Martín de Goiti, led a group which crossed from Burias and Ticao islands and landed on a coastal settlement called Ibalon in what is now the province of Sorsogon..From this point another expedition was sent to explore the interior and founded the town of Camalig.
In 1573, Spanish conquistador Juan de Salcedo penetrated the Bicol Peninsula from the north as made it as far south as Libon, establishing the settlement of Santiago de Libon..José María de Peñaranda, the first governor of Albay and a military engineer, was made corregidor of the province on 14 May 1834..He constructed public buildings and built roads and bridges..The entire Bicol Peninsula was organized as one province with two divisions, Camarines in the northwest and Ibalon in the southeast..In 1636, the two were separated.
Known centuries ago as the Tierra de Camarines, the province is distinctly Spanish-founded settlement..Its name having been derived from camaronchones or camarines, a Spanish word for kamalig referring to small nipa or bamboo-made huts by the natives.
In 1574, Governor-General Guido de Lavezaris referred Camarines Sur to the King of Spain as Los Camarines, after the abundance of camarins-rice granaries – which were conspicuous features of the area.
Spanish colonizers later subjugated its people and denominated the area into two distinct aggrupations.
Partido de Camarines was partitioned into Camarines Sur and Camarines Norte in 1829, and thereafter underwent fusion, annexations and re-partitions until 19 March 1919, when two provinces, jointly called Ambos Camarines, were finally separated with their present boundaries by decree of the First Philippine Legislature.
The Philippine Revolution started in Ambos Camarines when Elías Ángeles and Félix Plazo, Filipino corporals in the Spanish Army, sided with revolutionists and fought the local Spanish forces on 17 September 1898..Governor Vicente Zaidín capitulated to the revolutionists on the following day..With the arrival of General Vicente Lukbán, the revolutionary government in the Bicol Region was established.
American invasion era
The American forces occupied the Bicol Peninsula in January 1900..In March of the same year..General John M. Bell was made the military governor of the southeastern Luzon..Civil government was finally established in Ambos Camarines in April 1901.
Japanese occupation era
During World War II, Camarines Sur came under Japanese occupation in late December 1941, following the capture of Naga City on 18 December, a few days after the Japanese invasion of Legaspi.
On 8 March 1942, the famous Tangcong Vaca Guerrilla Unit (TVGU) was organized in San Nicolás, Canaman, with Juan Miranda as the Commanding Officer, León Aureus as the Executive Officer and Elìas Madrid as the Finance Officer..Among the numerous Canamanons who joined-up soon afterwards either in the unit's intelligence or combat components were José and Antonio Madrid, Mamerto Sibulo, Andrés Fortaleza, Marcos Severo, Dámaso Avenilla, Federico Crescini, Nicolás Vargas, Venancio Begino, Eugenio Ragodón, Juan Pachica, Santiago Amaro, José Gervás, Pedro Ángeles, Aproniano López, Andrés Alzate, Modesto Sánchez, Blas Alcántara, Andrés Aguilar, Florencio Frondozo, Alfredo de la Torre, and Flaviano Estrada.
The military general headquarters and military camp bases of the Philippine Commonwealth Army were active from 3 January 1942 until 30 June 1946, and the Philippine Constabulary was active from 28 October 1944 to 30 June 1946, in the province of Camarines Sur..The Filipino soldiers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary were spearheading the local military special operations in Bicol Region with the Bicolano guerrilla units decisively aiding them.
In 1945, Bicolano guerrillas including Filipino and American liberation forces liberated Camarines Sur from the Japanese forces towards the end of WWII and were involved in the liberation efforts.
Philippine Independence

Religion
Main article: Religion in the Philippines
Prior to colonization, the region had a complex religious system which involved various deities..Among these deities include:
Gugurang, the supreme god who dwells inside of Mount Mayon where he guards and protects the sacred fire in which Asuang, his brother was trying to steal..Whenever people disobey his orders or commit numerous sins, he would cause Mount Mayon to burst lava as a sign of warning for people to mend their crooked ways..Ancient Bikolanos had a rite performed for him called Atang.
Asuang, the evil god who always tries to steal the sacred fire of Mount Mayón from his brother, Gugurang..Addressed sometimes as Aswang, he dwells mainly inside Mount Malinao..As an evil god, he would cause the people to suffer misfortunes and commit sins..Enemy of Gugurang and a friend of Bulan, the god of the moon.
Haliya, the masked goddess of the moonlight and protector of Bulan and the arch-enemy of Bakunawa..Her cult is composed primarily of women..There is also a ritual dance named after her as it is performed to be a counter-measure against Bakunawa.
Bulan, the god of the pale moon, he is depicted as a pubescent boy with uncommon comeliness that made savage beast and the vicious mermaids (Magindara) tame..He has deep affection towards the sea god Magindang, but plays with him by running away so that Magindang would never catch him..The reason for this is because he is shy to the man that he loves..If Magindang manages to catch Bulan, Haliya always comes to free him from Magindang's grip.
Magindang, the god of the sea and all its creatures..He has deep affection to the lunar god Bulan and pursues him despite never catching him..Due to this, the Bicolanos reasoned that it is to why the waves rise to reach the Moon when seen from the distant horizon..Whenever he does catch up to Bulan, Haliya comes to rescue Bulan and free him immediately.
Bakunawa, a gigantic sea serpent deity who is often considered as the cause of eclipses, the devourer of the Sun and the Moon, and an adversary of Haliya as Bakunawa's main aim is to swallow Bulan, who Haliya swore to protect for all of eternity.
Okot, god of forest and hunting.

Languages
The main languages spoken in Camarines Sur are the Coastal Bikol (especially Central Bikol) and Inland Bikol group of languages..The latter is a group of languages that includes Albay Bikol group and Rinconada Bikol, while the former just consists dialects.
Coastal Bikol (Central Bikol)
A dialect of Coastal Bikol, called Coastal Bikol-Partido is used in the eastern portion of the province around Lagonoy Gulf, and another dialect called Coastal Bikol-Central is spoken around Naga City.
The Canaman dialect of Central Bikol variant of Coastal Bikol spoken in Canaman, Camarines Sur is said to be the ""purest"" form of Bikol (according to Jesuit anthropologist Frank Lynch, S.J..), though most linguists just consider it as the standard form of Central Bikol language since other Coastal Bikol languages, Rinconada Bikol and Buhinon (both Inland Bikol) are separate languages.
Rinconada Bikol
The Rinconada Bikol also known as Riŋkonāda (under the umbrella of Inland Bikol group of languages), is used by most people in the Rinconada area or district of the province especially in Nabua, Iriga City and by people of Rinconada in diaspora..Buhinon (one of the languages of Albay Bikol group, another member of Inland Bikol), is a minority language spoken in the town of Buhi and around Lake Buhi..Most inhabitants of Camarines Sur understand Tagalog and English.
Isarog Agta

The Isarog Agta people live within the circumference of Mount Isarog, though only 5 of them still know their indigenous language..They are one of the original Negrito settlers in the entire Philippines..They belong to the Aeta people classification, but have distinct language and belief systems unique to their own culture and heritage.
Urban history
Camarines Sur had urban areas since the Spanish Colonial Period with Naga City (or Nueva Caceres) becoming urban in the 19th century due to it being the center of commerce in the former province of Ambos Camarines..Nabua (Which formerly included present day Balatan), Libmanan (Then included present day Cabusao and some barangays of Canaman Pamplona and Pasacao), Sipocot, Pili, Calabanga, Iriga then followed Nueva Caceres with some barangays being classified as urban.
By the late 1990s the remaining rural municipalities were Siruma, Garchitorena, Presentacion and Cabusao..Until 2007 when all of these 4 municipalities were classified as urban by the National Statistics Office.

The economy of Camarines Sur is mostly agriculture-based..29 of the 35 towns are agricultural and produce rice, corn, feedmeal, freshwater fish, livestock, coconut, sugar, abacá, and water-lily.
Entrepreneurs engage in trading, often branching out towards neighboring provinces in the south as local demand might be limited by the 3rd to 5th income-class municipalities..Handicrafts are the major source of rural income, providing a fairly large share in the small-scale industries of the province..Forestry and papermaking are other sources of livelihood..The manufacture of abacá products such as Manila hemp, hats, bags, mats, and slippers is one of the main sources of income in the rural areas..Fishing is also done along both shores of the province..Tourism, primarily because of Caramoan and Mount Isarog, also generates income for Camarines Sur.
Naga and several towns have a tri-economy or three-base economy: commerce, industry, and agriculture..As the main center in the Bicol Region, all of the products from other provinces in the region are brought to Naga..It has four major industries: the manufacture of jewelry and gifts/toys/housewares, and processing of pineapple and coconut..Naga also has vast cornfields, rice fields, and water lily farms all over the city.
Calabanga, Cabusao, Libmanan and Sipocot have similar economies to Naga City..Calabanga has commerce from goods moving out of Naga, and is the trade center for the towns of Tinambac, Bombon, Cabusao, and Siruma and further Mercedes in Camarines Norte..Calabanga also has fishing from the Quipayo Fishing Center (the largest in Bicol), and vast productions of corn, sugar, and rice, which benefit from a large granary..Libmanan has 156 hectares of ricefields and cornfields, and fishing along its coastline connecting the towns of Ragay and Pasacao; Libmanan also has a commercial district..Sipocot has an agricultural base economy, with an abundant stock of native chicken (Sipocot's OTOP) and wide production of calamansi and other vegetables, while also serving as trading post for towns of Cabusao, Lupi, Del Gallego, Libmanan Ragay and Mercedes (Camarines Norte) Tagkawayan (Quezon Province) ..Fish products from these towns are received by Sipocot..Other towns not mentioned have a fishing industry as the main base of their economy.
Naga City, Iriga City, and Pili are the main economic centers of Camarines Sur.
The towns of Nabua, Goa, Calabanga, Libmanan, Pasacao, Sipocot, Baao are also taking successful steps towards urbanization and competitiveness.
Milaor, Camaligan, Canaman, Magarao, Gainza serves as a sub-urban area of Naga City.
The rest of the province takes a long time to urbanize due to lack of major roads, or isolation from business centers.

Camiguin, officially the Province of Camiguin (Cebuano: Probinsya sa Camiguin; Tagalog: Lalawigan ng Camiguin; Kamigin: Probinsya ta Kamigin), is an island province in the Philippines located in the Bohol Sea, about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) off the northern coast of mainland Mindanao..It is geographically part of Region X, the Northern Mindanao Region of the country and formerly a part of Misamis Oriental province.
Camiguin is the second-smallest province in the country in both population and land area after Batanes.
The province is famous for its sweet lanzones, to which its annual Lanzones Festival is dedicated and celebrated every third weekend of October..It is home to lush interior forest reserves, collectively known as the Mount Hibok-Hibok Protected Landscape, which has been declared by all Southeast Asian nations as an ASEAN Heritage Park..The province also boasts three National Cultural Treasures, namely, the Old Bonbon Church ruins in Catarman, the Sunken Cemetery of Catarman, and the Spanish-era watchtower in Guinsiliban..The three sites were declared for “possessing outstanding historical, cultural, artistic and/or scientific value which is highly significant and important to the country and nation.”
Additionally, the island province has numerous Important Cultural Treasures, such as the Old Mambajao Fountain - situated in the town's rotonda, the Old Mambajao Municipal Building, the façade of the Santo Rosario Church in Sagay, and 14 heritage and ancestral houses..The sites were declared for “having exceptional cultural, artistic and historical significance to the Philippines.” All cultural treasures were declared by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts..There have been moves to establish a dossier nomination for the province to be included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Camiguin is sometimes called Camiguin Sur (""South Camiguin"") or Camiguin de Mindanao to distinguish it from Camiguin de Babuyanes of the Babuyan Islands, which in turn is referred to as Camiguin Norte (""North Camiguin"")..Both are volcanic islands.
Etymology
The name Camiguin is derived from the native word Kamagong, a species of ebony tree that thrives near Lake Mainit in the province of Surigao del Norte, in the mainland Mindanao, where the earlier inhabitants of the islands, the Manobos, originated..Kamigin, the local dialect of Camiguin, is the northernmost variant of the Manobo languages.
An earlier Spanish geography book spells the island as Camiguing..There is reason to suppose the Spaniards dropped the final g,: 42  given how the phoneme /ŋ/ does not exist in Spanish..Today it is rendered as Camiguín.
History
Early history
The island of Camiguin is believed to have been first inhabited by the Manobo people of Surigao del Norte, as evidenced by the distinctly connected language between the two groups..The island was used as a trading stop point by various merchants and traders from the Rajahnate of Butuan, the Kedatuan of Dapitan, the ancient people of the Anda peninsula, and possibly the Rajahnate of Cebu and the animist Maranao of Lanao before the Islamization of the Lanao provinces.
Spanish colonial era
Old Spanish documents indicate that the renowned explorers Ferdinand Magellan and Miguel Lopez de Legaspi landed in Camiguin in 1521 and 1565, respectively..The first Spanish settlement was established in 1598 in what is now Guinsiliban..Guinsiliban, which comes from the old Kinamiguin word Ginsil-ipan (which means “to look out for pirates from a watchtower”) has an old Spanish watchtower where the Camiguinons kept watch for Moro pirates.
The first major Spanish settlement, established in 1679, was called Katagman or Katadman (known as Catarman)..The settlement grew and prospered but was destroyed by the eruption of Mt..Vulcan in 1871..The former location is what is now Barangay Bonbon of Catarman.
Sagay, located south of Catarman, was formally established as a town in 1848..The word Sagay is derived from the name of poisonous fruit trees that grow in the area..Mambajao became a town in 1855..The name was coined from the Visayan terms mamahaw, meaning to usher breakfast, and bajao, which is leftover boiled rice..In the early 1900s, Mambajao prospered and became the busiest port in Northern Mindanao..Mahinog was established as a municipality in 1860..The name Mahinog comes from a Visayan word meaning ""to ripen"" or ""to become ripe""..Although Guinsiliban was the oldest settlement in the island, it was only in 1950 that it became a municipality..Mahinog was formerly governed by Mambajao while Guinsiliban was formally governed from Sagay.
American invasion era
In 1901, in the middle of the Philippine–American War, American soldiers landed in Camiguin to assume political control over the island..A group of Camiguinons, armed with bolos and spears, led by Valero Camaro, fought them in a short battle in Catarman..Valero Camaro was killed by a bullet in the forehead..Further study is needed before he and his band can be recognized as patriots in the same way the Katipuneros are recognized..There is no study that identifies an independence movement in Camiguin during the American occupation..However, a small detail with regards to the colonial resistance in Cagayan, Misamis indicates that Camiguinons supported in a clandestine way the revolutionary activities of the Cagayanons against the new colonizers..They offered their arms and ammunitions and a typewriter to the revolucionarios in Cagayan.
In 1903, the first public school in Camiguin was built in Mambajao but what is known today as the Mambajao Central School was completed in 1912..On September 9, 1904, the first public water system, known as Las Aguas Potables de Mambajao, spearheaded by an admired civic leader by the name of Placido Reyes and co-operated by townspeople, was inaugurated.
Japanese occupation era
On June 18, 1942, the Japanese Imperial Army landed in Camiguin and set up a government in Mambajao..They gutted central Mambajao in reprisal to guerrilla activities in the area..The remains of some of these buildings still exist today.
Philippine independence
On July 4, 1946, the Philippines gained independence from the US..Camiguin was then part of Misamis Oriental..On June 22, 1957, Camiguin formally became a subprovince of Misamis Oriental through Republic Act No..2021 signed by President Carlos P. Garcia.
Finally, on June 18, 1966 Camiguin was made into a separate province  through Republic Act No..4669
Camiguinon citizens were among those who were victims of the human rights abuses during Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos; some of them were among the Northern Mindanaoans whose grievances were formally recognized and granted the right to reparations in 2014.

Mount Butay is located near the Port of Benoni.
Mount Guisiliban is the southernmost volcano of the island.
Islands
Located just a few kilometers off the coast are the two islands of Camiguin.
White Island can be accessed from Agoho which is about 5 km (3.1 mi) west of the town of Mambajao.
Mantigue Island can be reached from Mahinog about 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) south of Mambajao.
Springs
Ardent Hibok-Hibok Hot Spring — At the foot of Hibok-Hibok Volcano flow the mineral pools of Ardent Hot Springs..Wisps of steam can be seen rising from the running waters heated by the cauldron of the mountain, the most recently active of the seven volcanoes on the island.
Santo Niño Cold Springs and Bura Natural Soda Water Swimming Pool in Catarman are other popular places to get a relaxing dip on the island.
Tangub Hot Spring is an interesting hot spring located on the shore close to the Sunken Cemetery..Most of the spring is submerged and can be partly seen during low tide..The spring can also be examined by scuba diving or snorkeling, as visibility is excellent and it is also a recommended spot for observing underwater life.
Sunken Cemetery in 2018
Sunken cemetery
During the volcanic birth of Mt..Vulcan lasting from 1871 to about 1875, some areas in the town of Bonbon subsided, sinking the cemetery of the town to below sea level..The place is commemorated by a huge cross erected in 1982.
Katibawasan Falls
Since then the municipality of Bonbon has been transferred to the town of Catarman.
Waterfalls
Katibawasan Falls — Located 5 km (3.1 mi) southeast of Mambajao, the Katibawasan Falls cascades 250 ft (76 m) down to a pool surrounded by orchids and ferns..An invigorating dip in the pool is popular, especially on warmer days, and there are also several hiking trails within the park..This is the favorite jump-off point for trekkers and mountaineers in search of adventure on the slopes of Mt..Timpoong.
Tuasan Falls is located 6 km (3.7 mi) northeast of Catarman..Unfortunately, accessing the falls no longer entails a scenic hike passing through the Barrio of Mainit, Catarman and along the rocky river bed..The local government, to accommodate local tourism, decided in 2012 to improve access to the falls with a road built all the way up to the falls, which was finished in late 2014..Cars may be parked near the waterfalls, and from there it's just a few minutes to reach the falls and the pool..The pool at the base of the waterfall is deep and clear..As of March 2015, the local government is finalizing construction of the ""Trans Island Highway"", a road crossing Camiguin from Catarman to Mambajao which runs directly to the left of Tuasan Falls.
Protected areas
Timpoong and Hibok-Hibok Natural Monument — Located in the central and western portions of Camiguin, the natural monument preserves an important watershed and center of biodiversity in the Mount Hibok-Hibok and Timpoong ranges..As the island's only remaining forest, it supports the vast majority of the island's endemic and endangered flora and fauna such as the Camiguin hanging parrot, Camiguin hawk-owl and Camiguin forest mouse.
Giant Clam Sanctuary — Established by a non-government organization called Kabila Giant Clam Conservation and Ocean Nursery, this area is home to various species of corals and giant clams..Currently, 7 out of 9 species of giant clams can be found in the sanctuary.

Natural calamities
Volcanic activity from 1871 to 1875
On February 16, 1871, earthquakes began to be felt on the island, which increased in severity until April 30, when a volcanic fissure opened up 400 yards southwest of the village of Catarman, northwest of Hibok-Hibok Volcano..Mt..Vulcan was born and continued erupting and pouring lava into the sea, at the same time gaining in height and width..In 1875, the Challenger expedition visited the area and described the mountain as a dome, 1,950 ft (590 m) in height, without any crater, but still smoking and incandescent at the top..: 42
The old town of Catarman was destroyed and a portion of the town sank beneath the sea..The settlement moved to where the town center is presently located..All that remains today of Catarman Viejo are the ruins of the ancient Spanish church, a convent, and a bell tower.
Eruptions from 1948 to 1951
From 1948 to 1951, Mt..Hibok-Hibok was constantly rumbling and smoking..The first minor eruption in 1948 caused little damage and loss of life, but in 1949, a larger eruption caused 79 deaths due to pyroclastic flows..The largest eruption occurred in the morning of December 4, 1951..The volcano unleashed lava flows, poisonous gases, and pyroclastic flows destroying nearly 19 square kilometers of land, particularly in Mambajao..All in all, over 3,000 people were killed..Before the eruption of Mt..Hibok-Hibok in 1951, the population of Camiguin had reached 69,000..After the eruption, the population was reduced to about 34,000 due to massive out-migration..Most who left moved to the mainland Mindanao, mainly around Misamis Oriental.
Typhoon of 2001
A disastrous typhoon hit the province in the dawn of November 7, 2001..The tropical storm named Lingling (local name Nanang) brought buhawi (torrential downpours) on the mountains, causing multiple massive mudslides which killed about 200 inhabitants, most of whom were missing.

Spanish colonial era
The account of early Spanish explorers about Capiz and its people was traced back in 1566 when the Spaniards set foot in the mouth of Banica river.
Early settlements were seen in the town of Panay..The town was originally called Bamban..The name was changed by the early Spaniards to Panay, a word which means ""mouth of the river."".This is also the location of a fortress built by Juan de la Isla
When the Spaniards led by Miguel López de Legazpi came to Panay from Cebu in 1569, after sailing from Mexico, they found people with tattoos, and so they called the island Isla de los Pintados.
How the island itself came to be called Panay is uncertain..The Aeta (Negritos) called it Aninipay, after a plant that abounded in the island..Legend has it that López de Legazpi and his men, in search of food, exclaimed upon the island, pan hay en esta isla!.""There is bread in this island""!.and the island of Panay closely resembles the shape of a heart and the heart of Jesus Christ is considered present in the Eucharistic Bread..The Spanish then came and established their first settlement on the island at the mouth of the Banica River and called it Panay..This was the second Spanish settlement in the Philippines, following San Miguel, Cebu..Unknown to many, Calle Revolución in Panay is the second oldest street in the Philippines after Calle Colón in Cebu City, Central Visayas.
Later in 1569, Captain Diego de Artieda, who was sent by López de Legazpi, landed in the town of Panay and proclaimed it as the capital of the province..Later, the Spaniards moved the capital to its present site upon founding the town of Capiz (not the province, and now Roxas City) which was near the sea and provided docking facilities.
In 1716, the province was created a separate encomienda and was later organized into a politico-military unit..By the end of the 1700s, Capiz had 11,459 native families and 89 Spanish Filipino families..: 31, 54, 113
The Panayanon's noble character and royal blood shone out in later centuries when fellow people from Panay island, at Iloilo City was given by the Queen of Spain, the Royal Title of ""Most Loyal and Noble City"" for being the most ardent and faithful city in the Spanish Empire and had remained loyal to Spain while the entire empire collapsed.
Although Capiz joined the Tagalog-led Philippine Revolution, the Spaniards didn't surrender to the Tagalogs but they did surrender to the people of Iloilo and eventually Iloilo and Capiz were part of the same Federal Republic of the Visayas a substate which was formed within the First Philippine Republic, the first capital of which was in Cavite while the United States of America had betrayed the Philippine Revolution which they initially supported and influential American officers swore allegiance to..These American officers betrayed their oaths and occupied Manila.
American invasion era
The American takeover of the Philippines resulted in the establishment of a civil government in Capiz on April 15, 1901, by virtue of Act 115.
Japanese occupation era
On April 16, 1942, Imperial Japanese forces landed on Capiz City and occupied the rest of the province..However, on December 20, 1944, Capizanon guerrillas, whose forces already occupied most of the province, liberated the capital from Japanese hands, leading to the full liberation of the province.
Philippine independence
Capiz and Aklan were united under one province until 25 April 1956, when President Ramon Magsaysay signed into law Republic Act 1414 separating the two entities.

Catanduanes (/ˌkɑːtɑːnˈdwɑːnɛs/; Tagalog pronunciation:
The province comprises Catanduanes (mainland or main island), Panay Island, Lete Island, the Palumbanes group of islands (Porongpong, Tignob and Calabagio), and a few other small, surrounding islets and rocks..The province is also home to various mollusk fossil sites, notably the second-oldest ammonite site in the Philippines..These sites have certain species of ammonites that are found nowhere else in Southeast Asia..Because of the province's importance and rich geologic history, various scholars have suggested that, if the province would take the initiative to put its name forward in nomination, it would stand a good chance of being named as a UNESCO Geopark Reserve.
In the early 1900s, Catanduanes was a sub-province of Ambos Camarines..Later, it was a sub-province of Albay..It became an autonomous province in 1945..Congressman Francisco Perfecto filed House Bill No..301, which separated the province from Albay; the bill was approved on September 26, 1945, and signed into law by President Sergio Osmeña on October 24, 1945..Remigio Socito, previously the Lieutenant Governor, was appointed the first Provincial Governor..When elections were held in 1947, Alfonso V. Usero became the first elected Governor.
On April 15, 2022, President Rodrigo Duterte signed the Republic Act No..11700 declaring Catanduanes province as the Philippines Abacá Capital.
Etymology
Catanduanes' earliest recorded name was Isla de Cobos..This was the name given to it by Spanish conquistadores, early in 1573, when they came upon several tribes on the island who were living in the thatched huts that the tribal people called cobos.
“Catanduanes” comes from the words tandu, a native beetle, and samdong, a native species of tree, both were found throughout the island..People often referred to the island as katanduan or kasamdongan, meaning ‘a place where the tandu and the samdong tree thrive in abundance.’ The pronunciation of this word by Spanish-speaking people led to the coining of the Hispanicized version, Catanduanes.

Early history
Rulers (datus) from Borneo settled on the island of Panay..Their descendants then migrated throughout the archipelago and became the first settlers in Catanduanes.
The island was raided more than once by the Moros, who lived on the island of Mindanao..As a result of these destructive raids, many records of the past were destroyed or lost.
Spanish period
In 1573, Juan de Salcedo arrived in Catanduanes while hunting for pirates and conquered the natives..Three years later, a galleon expedition from Acapulco was shipwrecked near the island, and the survivors were either killed or enslaved..This event is commemorated at the Batalay Church in Bato, a few kilometers outside the capital town of Virac.
Evangelization and Christianization
The evangelization of the island started twenty years later, when the Spanish soldiers, after subjugating the Bicol mainland, came back with Franciscan missionaries..The missionaries, armed with the cross and backed by the sword of the conquistadors, evangelized the entire population, beginning with the southern tribes, without meeting much resistance.
From 1600 to 1857, the colonizers established nine local centers of government through the establishment of parishes: Caramoran (1601); Pandan (1650); Viga (1661); Panganiban (1663); Virac (1775); Bato (1830); and San Andres (1853).
American invasion era
During the period of American rule, Bagamanoc, which had been a thriving municipality during the Spanish period, was reduced to a mere barrio of Viga and later of Panganiban.
During the American Regime, some locals refused to recognize the sovereignty of the United States, and most of them fled to the mountains..The American occupation did not last long..By 1934, the Americans had withdrawn from control of the island.
Japanese occupation era
During World War II, Catanduanes was not spared from Japanese invasion..The Japanese erected garrisons in different parts of the island and heavily fortified it.
Philippine independence
Three months after the Philippine independence from the Americans, Catanduanes was finally recognized as a separate and independent province from Albay through Commonwealth Act No..687 authored by then Representative Francisco Perfecto..The independence was approved by Congress on September 26, 1945, signed into law by President Sergio Osmena Sr. on October 24, 1945, and took effect on October 26, 1945.
Catanduanes became the sixth province of the Bicol Region with the signing of the Act..Remigio Socito, Catanduanes's last Lieutenant Governor was appointed as the first Provincial Governor..When elections were held in 1947, Alfonso V. Usero became the first elected Governor.
On September 26, 1945, Catanduanes was recognized as a separate and independent province..By Republic Act No..159, dated June 26, 1947, the municipality of Caramoran was recreated out of the Municipality of Pandan; under R.A. No..491, dated June 12, 1950, the Municipality of Bagamanoc was also created.
Gigmoto formally became a municipality again in 1951, as did San Miguel in 1952..Also in the early 1950s, another center of government, Baras, was created..It was during this period that the island saw economic development and growth..Interlinking roads were built and trading centers were created.
Geography
Catanduanes is situated on the easternmost edge of Luzon: 13.3 to 14.1 degrees north latitudes and between 124.1 and 124.3 degrees east longitudes..The island bounded on the west by the Maqueda Channel, on the south by Lagonoy Gulf, and on the north and east by the Philippine Sea..Several small islands comprise the province..Its aggregate land area totals approximately 1,492.16 square kilometres (576.13 sq mi)..The coastlines, that stretch to almost 400 km (249 mi), are jagged with many bays.
The topography of Catanduanes Island is rugged and mountainous, becoming more pronounced towards the central portion of the island..Less than 10 percent of the land area has a slope gradient under 8 percent, mostly fractured and narrow strips of plains located along the coastal areas where most of the inhabitants are settled..The highest mountain peak is in Boctot, located between the municipalities of Virac and San Miguel with an elevation of 803 metres (2,635 ft) above sea level..It is the premier mountain range with broadly spread old-growth forests and watershed which exerts widespread influence over its immediate environs that include the municipalities of Virac, Bato, and San Miguel..Other prominent mountain forms include the ranges: Obi in Caramoran, Cagmasoso in San Andres, and the Summit and Magsumoso ranges within the Viga and Gigmoto areas.
The lowlands include the Virac Plain, Viga Plain, San Andres Plain and the Bato River Flood Plain..The coastal municipalities with limited lowland agricultural areas are Pandan and Caramoran..The more extensive lowlands are found in the southern parts of the province..The largest coastal plain is the contiguous wetlands of Viga, Panganiban and Bagamanoc over which lies the widest area of rice paddies and nipa mangroves.
The province is mostly rugged and mountainous terrain..Its slope characteristics are 13% gently sloping to undulating, 1% classified rolling to hilly, 2% very hills and mountains, 47% level to very gently sloping, 32% steep hills and mountainous, and 5% undulating to rolling..Ten of the eleven municipalities of the province is situated along the coastal fringes, over which locate its mostly fractured plains..The only landlocked municipality is San Miguel with its poblacion (town center) sitting in a location entirely devoid of flatlands..The majority of the built-up areas occupy zones that are classified as flat to rolling.
Flora and Fauna

The island is a biodiversity hotspot..Its rainforests are home to the Philippine brown deer, flying foxes, and other endemic bat species, warty pigs, civets, cobras, giant pythons, monitor lizards, sailfin lizards and other endemic animals..Exotic bird species such as the Philippine hornbill, rail, parrot, bittern, egret, pheasant, coot, lapwing, plover, Philippine duck, quail, owl, oriole, kingfisher, swiftlets and many more are also found..A record of ""Philippines Birding Trip Reports"" has found out massive bird species in several parts of the island such as the watershed and timberland forests reserve in Gigmoto where scattered deer populations are also usually reported.
The Catanduanes bleeding-heart (Gallicolumba luzonica rubiventris) had experienced over-exploitation in the late 20th century..Although most forests are still intact, this species has suffered over-hunting, making it very rare and is believed to be near extinction or already extinct as its last reported specimen was collected in 1971.
The southern giant slender-tailed cloud rat (budkon/bugkon), which is found only in Catanduanes and the southern half of Luzon Island, is still widely reported..It is critically endangered as humans hunt them for food and to some extent, as pets..In mainland Luzon, sightings of the creature are already rare while in Marinduque, it is generally considered extinct.
Inventory of the entomological fauna in the island has been conducted by various scientific institutions..A survey which was submitted to the national museum has revealed interesting species in the forest reserve of Gigmoto and Pandan..A total of 2,000 entomological specimens and its allies were collected compromising 323 species under 45 genera and 50 families.
The Catanduanes narrow-mouthed frog (Kaloula kokacii), an arboreal amphibian found only in Catanduanes and some parts of Bicol, enjoys
One of the very recent species found in Catanduanes and portions of Bicol region is the new loam-swimming skink, a legless reptile with its assigned scientific name Brachymeles makusog.
The dipterocarp forest also harbor numerous tropical plant species including the threatened species of pitcher plants and rafflesia as well as endemic banana varieties..Many highly economical hardwood trees such as yakal, apitong, palosapis, and molave are still found in the central forests through local reports indicate that these species are already threatened..Mangrove forests exist in several coastal areas but the largest locations are in Banquerohan (Viga-Panganiban), Agoho in San Andres and Batalay in Bato.
The Catanduanes reefs harbor many endangered and threatened types of mollusks such as giant Triton, cowries, abalone, cone snails, conches, octopuses, squids, and nautiluses..Marine mammals are also reported to frequent on its eastern coasts such as species of dolphins and whales, which appear from March to June..Many edible marine algae such as caulerpa, valonia, and turbellaria also grow abundantly on its rough coasts.
The island is nestled in the very beginning of the Kuroshio Current, a sea current that runs through the eastern Philippines, Taiwan, and Japan..Tuna migration, which is at its peak in the months of April and May, can be seen in the Maqueda channel..Dugongs were once known to swim on Catanduanes coasts, but this event is already becoming extremely rare.
The Catanduanes coast is one of the best spots for flying fish population; a flying fish can attain its fullest size in Catanduanes which may weigh 300 grams (11 oz)..Rabbitfish Siganus sp., a kind of reef fish is one of the most heavily exploited marine tropical fish in Catanduanes..Its fry that comes out in shallow coasts during the breeding season (March–May) are fished in large volumes..Approximately 10 million rabbitfish fries are caught annually..That natural event supplies food for many people but its ecological impact can be devastating..Nature advocates started to strengthen their campaign for an eco-dialogue for this matter..Sea cucumbers are also abundant in many islets of the eastern coasts facing the Philippine Sea.
Palumbanes (province satellite group of islands) has beaches with fine yellowish-white sand..It is also one of the most biodiverse marine zones of the island..However, coral reef exploitation has severely inflicted for the last 10 years on its waters..The local government and some sectors are already undergoing efforts to revive Palumbanes Island through building artificial reefs and employing fishing regulations.

Without a pronounced dry season, precipitation is distributed fairly well throughout the year becoming wetter in the last quarter into the early months of the first quarter, when tropical disturbances and monsoon winds especially the Northeast Monsoon (Amihan) bring in heavy rains..Other months are characterized by short periods of dryer days and fine weather, except in July and August when the dry and gusty southwest monsoon winds intensify.
Catanduanes' geographical position has it lying completely exposed to the Philippine Sea..Therefore, it is known as ""Land of the Howling Winds"" because it is frequently visited by tropical cyclones.
Administrative divisions
Catanduanes comprises 11 municipalities, all encompassed by the lone district.

Religion
Main article: Religion in the Philippines
Prior to colonization, the region had a complex religious system which involved various deities..Among these deities include: Gugurang, the supreme god who dwells inside of Mount Mayon where he guards and protects the sacred fire in which Aswang, his brother was trying to steal..Whenever people disobey his orders, wishes and commit numerous sins, he would cause Mount Mayon to burst lava as a sign of warning for people to mend their crooked ways..Ancient Bikolanos had a rite performed for him called Atang..;
Catholicism
Further information: Roman Catholic Diocese of Virac
Roman Catholicism is the religion of the vast majority, comprising 97% of Catanduanes' population.
Others
The remaining faith of the inhabitants is divided into the various groups such as Aglipayan Church, Baptists, Methodists, and other evangelical Christians, as well as Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, Iglesia ni Cristo, Seventh-day Adventists as well as Muslims.
Languages
There are two variants of the Bikol languages native to this island province: Northern Catanduanes Bicolano and Southern Catanduanes Bicolano..The northern accent has a very pronounced letter ""R"" that becomes a diphthong of non-vowel letters ""L"" and ""R"" in the southern towns..In written form, the conventional mainland language like Central Bikol is used..Filipino, by virtue of being officially taught in schools and the affinity of most Bicolanos to it, is the second most common language and easily the most understood by most people..English is the normal medium used in primary communications..The use of the Spanish language as a local language seems to have vanished after the turn of the early 21st century.
Sociolinguistics
When the Spaniards came to the Philippines, Catanduanes, being on the Pacific Ocean side and on the
very route of the galleon ships, was one of the first places they penetrated to propagate Christianity..The Spanish priests founded churches in every town..People from mainland Bicol also traveled to Catanduanes, specifically Caramoran, which is directly across from Albay.
The research of McFarland on the year 1974, the dialects of Bicol area, stated that until the advent of the twentieth century and the development brought about by modernization, Northern Catanduanes was quite isolated from mainland Bicol and Southern Catanduanes, resulting in less opportunity for contact between different groups..One probable reason why the Northern Catanduanes language variety is distinct from the Southern Catanduanes variety is that the mountainous terrain separating the north from the south acts as a barrier to community interaction..The lack of good roads and transportation arising from the terrain contributed to the present situation..Since the seaport is in Virac, Northern Catanduanes remained in isolation from other subgroups for quite some time..Furthermore, the inhabitants of Northern Catanduanes were the first occupants of the island to have been pushed northwards when immigrants from the mainland occupied the southern part of the island..This supports the closeness of the Southern Catanduanes variety to other Bicol subgroups while the Northern Catanduanes variety has more distinct features.
Ethnic groups
The predominant ethnic group is the Bicolano people..Migrants from other parts of Luzon, as well as Visayas and Mindanao,  make up a minority as well..Few, who are of Chinese, Australian, American, and Spanish descent also live in the province.

From 2001 through 2010, the Philippines production of abaca fiber (Manila hemp) averaged 65,701 mt per year and was decreasing at a rate of at least 0.8% per annum..The decrease was caused by the devastating typhoons in 2006, abaca viral diseases that continued to affect the plantations, and the dampened foreign demand brought about by the global economic recession beginning in the latter part of 2008, the most severe downturn since the Great Depression in the 1930s..Production reached its peak in 2008 at 77,387 mt as outputs of all producing regions, particularly Bicol, Davao Region and Caraga, substantially increased during the period..This was primarily the effect of the incremental production from the abaca plantations established in 2005 and 2006 under FIDA's program Goal I ""Development of New Agri-Business Lands"" and the continued strong demand and attractive prices offered for the fiber by local traders, processors/manufacturers, and exporters..The abaca industry, however, suffered a setback in 2009 when fiber yield slumped to its lowest level of 54,584 mt due to the weakened market demand and falling prices as a consequence of the worldwide financial crisis..Catanduanes Island is the native habitat of the endemic abaca plant (a banana relative), which is globally renowned for its strong fiber..In fact, the Philippines FIDA (Fiber Industry Development Authority) declared the island as the highest abaca-producing province in 2010.
In 2009–2013, The Philippine Rural Development Program (PRDP) and the Department of Agriculture, Bicol Region had 39% share of Philippine Abaca production, emerged as the biggest produce while overwhelming 92% comes from Catanduanes the biggest abaca-producing province in the country..The home of the finest grade of abaca fiber..Lately, the indigenous abaca fiber, commonly called ""pinukpok,"" produced and woven by the locals of Baras, Catanduanes, has now found its niche in the local and international fashion industry..This indigenous fabric has shown its versatility in the globally appealing designs and creations of famous fashion designer Dita Sandico-Ong..Until now wild type of abaca can still be found in the interior forests of the province which is often not cultivated.
World's Abaca Top Producer
Despite having been ravaged by three super typhoons in the last two decades, Catanduanes has maintained its ""abaca country"" status as the top abaca fiber-producing province in the Philippines..In 2015 alone, the island's 12,789 abaca farmers produced 23,550 metric tons of raw fiber, comprising 40 percent of the total abaca fiber production nationwide..The local fiber harvest is even higher than the production of Ecuador, the second-biggest abaca producer in the world after the Philippines.
Agriculture and fishing
Catanduanes mud crab industry is being supported by the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Department of Science and Technology, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Department of Labor and Employment and Catanduanes State University.
The provincial government is maintaining the Catanduanes Crab Center (CCC) which serves as a source of crablets for grow-out and fattening by fishpond operators..It carries out a special program for ""queen"" or ""gravid"" crabs designed to ensure the sustainability of the industry in the province, which originally owned the ""crab capital of the Philippines"" title..The province's mud crab industry is focusing on the production of female crabs that play an important role in marketing, particularly in Asian countries such as Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.
Income
Commonwealth Act No..687, created Catanduanes as an independent province; however, it was Republic Act 7160 that gave the Local Government Unit (LGU) total independence in managing its administrative, fiscal, and development affairs in conformity with the national government thrust for sustainable social and economic growth.

Cavite, officially the Province of Cavite (Tagalog: Lalawigan ng Kabite; Chavacano: Provincia de Cavite), is a province in the Philippines located in the Calabarzon region in Luzon..Located on the southern shores of Manila Bay and southwest of Manila, it is one of the most industrialized and fastest-growing provinces in the Philippines..As of 2020, it has a population of
4,344,829, making it the most populated province in the country if the independent cities of Cebu are excluded from Cebu's population figure.
The de facto capital and seat of the government of the province is Trece Martires, although Imus is the official (de jure) capital while the City of Dasmariñas is the largest city in the province.
For over 300 years, the province played an important role in both the country's colonial past and eventual fight for independence, earning it the title ""Historical Capital of the Philippines""..It became the cradle of the Philippine Revolution, which led to the renouncement of Spanish colonial control, finally culminating in the Philippine Declaration of Independence on June 12, 1898 in Kawit..The old provincial capital, Cavite City also hosted docks for the Manila galleon, becoming an essential part of commerce between Asia and Latin America.
Originally an agricultural province, its northern cities of Bacoor, Imus, and Dasmariñas (with a combined population of 1,864,560 at the 2020 Census) are now suburbs of Metro Manila due to increasing urbanization in the late 20th century..This province forms part of the Greater Manila Area.
Etymology
The name ""Cavite"" comes from the Hispanicized form of kawit (alternatively kalawit), Tagalog for ""hook"", in reference to the small hook-shaped peninsula jutting out to Manila Bay.
Edmund Roberts, in his 1821 memoir, stated that the ""natives"" called it Caveit due to the ""crooked point of land extending into the sea"".
History
Early history
The present Cavite City was once a mooring place for Chinese junks that came to trade with the settlements around Manila Bay..The land was formerly known as ""Tangway""..Archeological evidence in coastal areas shows prehistorical settlements.
Spanish colonial period
The Spanish colonizers who arrived in the late 16th century saw the unusual tongue of land jutting out on Manila Bay and saw its deep waters as the main staging ground where they could launch their bulky galleons..It would later become the most important port linking the colony to the outside world through the Manila-Acapulco Galleon trade..In 1571, Spanish colonizers established the port and City of Cavite and fortified the settlement as a first line of defense for the city of Manila..Galleons were built and fitted at the port and many Chinese merchants settled in the communities of Bacoor and Kawit, opposite the Spanish city to trade silks, porcelain and other oriental goods.
""A defensive curtained wall was constructed the length of Cavite's western side,"" beginning from the entrance, ""La Estanzuela"", and continuing to the end of the peninsula, ""Punta de Rivera"", with the eastern shore unprotected by a wall..Cavite contained government offices, churches, mission buildings, Spanish homes, Fort San Felipe and the Rivera de Cavite shipyard..Docks were in place to construct galleons and galleys, but without a dry dock, ships were repaired by careening along the beach.
Fort San Felipe, La Fuerza de San Felipe, was built between 1609 and 1616..This quadrilateral structure of curtained walls, with bastions at the corners, contained 20 cannons facing the seashore..Three infantry companies, 180 men each, plus 220 Pampangan infantry, garrisoned the fort..: 142–143
The galleons Espiritu Santo and San Miguel, plus six galleys were constructed between 1606 and 1616..From 1729 to 1739, ""the main purpose of the Cavite shipyard was the construction and outfitting of the galleons for the Manila to Acapulco trade run.""
The vibrant mix of traders, Spanish seamen from Spain and its Latin-American colonies,
In 1614, the politico-military jurisdiction of Cavite was established..As with many other provinces organized during the Spanish colonial era, Cavite City, the name of the capital, was applied to the whole province, Cavite..The province covered all the present territory except for the town of Maragondon, which used to belong to the Corregimiento of Mariveles..Maragondon was ceded to Cavite in 1754 when Bataan province was created from Pampanga province.
Owing to its military importance, Cavite had been attacked by foreigners in their quest to conquer Manila and the Philippines..The Dutch made a surprise attack on the city in 1647, pounding the port incessantly, but were repulsed..In 1672, the British occupied the port during their two-year control in the Philippines.
In the 17th century, encomiendas (Spanish Royal land grants) were given in Cavite and Maragondon to Spanish conquistadores and their families..By the end of the 1700s, Cavite was the main port of Manila and was a province of 5,724 native families and 859 Spanish Filipino families..: 31, 54, 113
The religious orders began acquiring these lands, with some donated, enlarging vast haciendas (estates) in Cavite during the 18th and 19th centuries, enriching themselves..These haciendas became the source of bitter conflicts between the friar orders and Filipino farmers and pushed a number of Caviteños to live as outlaws..This opposition to the friar orders was an important factor that drove many Cavite residents to support reform, and later, independence.
In 1872, Filipinos launched their revolt against Spain..Three Filipino priests—Jose Burgos, Mariano Gomez and Jacinto Zamora—were implicated in the Cavite mutiny when 200 Filipinos staged a rebellion within Spanish garrisons..On August 28, 1896, when the revolution against Spain broke out, Cavite became a bloody theater of war..Led by Emilio Aguinaldo, Caviteños made lightning raids on Spanish headquarters, and soon liberated the entire province through the Battle of Alapan..Aguinaldo commanded the Revolution to its successful end – the proclamation of the First Republic of the Philippines on June 12, 1898, in Kawit.

Japanese occupation era

In May 1942, after the fall of Bataan and Corregidor Island, the Japanese Imperial forces occupied Cavite and made their presence felt in each town of the province and Cavite City itself, as well as in the young city of Tagaytay established in the 1930s.
After surviving the Bataan Death March and released from Capas, Tarlac concentration camp United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) Col. Mariano Castañeda, returned to Cavite and secretly organized the guerilla forces in the province.
The Japanese authorities pressured him to accept the position as Provincial Governor of Cavite, he refused many times over until his excuses did not work, much against his will he was forced to accept the position by the Japanese, and by thinking that it would be beneficial to further organize the resistance movement as Governor by day and a guerilla commander by night..Eventually, the Japanese discovered his guerilla connection and raided his house in the attempt to capture him, but he escaped along with Col. Lamberto Javalera by swimming the Imus river up to Salinas, Bacoor and finally joined his comrades in the field in Neneng, the General Headquarters of the Fil American Cavite Guerilla Forces (FACGF) located in Dasmariñas.
At this time due to his organizational skills the FACGF raised a regiment in each of the administrative units and also created attached special battalions..Overall, three special battalions, one medical battalion, one signal company, one hospital unit, and Division GHQ and Staff were raised to provide administrative and combat support..Later on, the FACGF, with a peak of 14,371 Enlisted Men and 1,245 officers, grew into a formidable force to take on the omnipresent rule of the Japanese in the province..At its peak the force contained 14 infantry regiments:
1st Infantry Regiment, Imus (Col. Lorenzo Saulog)
2nd Infantry Regiment, Bacoor (Col. Francisco Guererro)
3rd Infantry Regiment, Silang (Col. Dominador Kiamson)
4th Infantry Regiment, Dasmariñas (Col. Estanislao Mangubat Carungcong)
5th Infantry Regiment, Barangay Anabu, Imus (Col. Raymundo Paredes)
6th Infantry Regiment, Cavite City (Col. Amado Soriano)
7th Infantry Regiment, Alfonso (Col. Angeles Hernais)
8th Infantry Regiment, Naic (Col. Emilio Arenas)
9th Infantry Regiment, Mendez (Col. Maximo Rodrigo)
10th Infantry Regiment Kawit (Col. Hugo Vidal)
11th Infantry Regiment Imus (Col. Maximo Reyes)
12th Infantry Regiment, Amadeo (Col. Daniel Mediran)
13th Infantry Regiment, Rosario (Col. Ambrosio Salud)
14th Infantry Regiment, Brgy..Paliparan, Dasmariñas (Col. Emiliano De La Cruz)
On January 31, 1945, the liberation of the province of Cavite started with the combined forces of the American 11th Airborne Division under General Joseph Swing and Col. Harry Hildebrand and the valiant Caviteño guerilleros of the Fil-American Cavite Guerilla Forces, which liberated the province of Cavite from the Japanese occupiers, and protected at all costs the National Highway 17 (Aguinaldo Highway) from Tagaytay City to Las Piñas that serve as the vital supply route of the U.S. 11th Airborne Division, paving the way towards the road to the bitter but victorious Battle of Manila.
Philippine independence era
The economic growth of the country began to creep its way to the province following the end of the Second World War and the restoration of independence..Given its proximity to Manila, the province soon began to feel a transformation into an economic provider of food and industrial goods not just for Metro Manila but for the whole of the country.
The economy of Cavite remained largely agricultural during the decades after the war, from the 1940s to the 1980s, with attempts to create industrial estates in the early 1970s largely falling flat in light of the Crony Capitalism and economic crises of the late 1970s and early 1980s.
During the Marcos administration
Main article: Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos
The Philippines' gradual postwar recovery took a turn for the worse in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis being one of the early landmark events.
Another conflict faced by the Philippines throughout the last part of the 20th century had some of its roots in Cavite - the moro conflict, which was largely sparked by outrage in the wake of exposes about the Jabidah Massacre..The exposes told the story of how a group of moro men were recruited by the military for Operation Merdeka, Marcos' secret plan to invade Sabah and reclaim it from Malaysia, and trained them on the island of Corregidor, which is administered by Cavite province..When for various reasons the recruits decided that they no longer wanted to follow their officers' orders, their officers allegedly shot all the recruits to death, with only one survivor managing to live by feigning death..The exposes angered the Philippines' Muslim minority enough to trigger the Moro conflict, eventually leading to the creation of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).
In 1972, one year before the expected end of his last constitutionally allowed term as president in 1973, Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law.
The human rights abuses, crony capitalism, propagandistic construction projects, and personal expensive lifestyles of the Marcos Family
Presidential Decree No..1 of 1972 grouped the Provinces of the Philippines into administrative regions, and Cavite was organized into Region IV..The Luzon mainland provinces of this region - Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon - were prioritized for industrialization, and large amounts of agricultural land in Cavite were acquired for conversion into industrial estates throughout the 1970s and early 1980s.
Rosario was the first Cavite town to have several large industrial projects, including a refinery set up by FilOil Refinery Corporation.
One geographical feature of Cavite, Mount Sungay, was significantly altered in 1979 when First Lady Imelda Marcos ordered the construction of the Palace in the Sky, a mansion originally intended as a guesthouse for former California Governor Ronald Reagan (who never arrived)..This drastically reduced the height of the mountain, which had once been a landmark that helped guide sailors into Manila bay..The mansion remained unfinished after the People Power Revolution in 1986 that toppled the dictatorship of President Ferdinand Marcos..The new government renamed it the People's Park in the Sky, to show the excesses of the ousted regime.
Contemporary
In 2002, Region IV was split into two parts: Region IV-A, known as Calabarzon; and Region IV-B, known as Mimaropa.
Geography
Detailed topographic map of Cavite
Cavite is surrounded by Laguna province to the east, Metro Manila to the northeast, and Batangas province to the south..To the west lies the South China Sea.
Cavite is the second-smallest province in the Calabarzon region, only after Rizal..Cavite occupies a land area of 1,427.06 square kilometers (550.99 sq mi), which is approximately 8.46% of Calabarzon's total land area, 3.07% of the regional area and 0.48% of the total land area of the Philippines..The municipalities of Maragondon and Silang have the biggest land areas, comprising 165.49 square kilometers (63.90 sq mi) and 156.41 square kilometers (60.39 sq mi) respectively, while the municipality of Noveleta has the smallest land area as indicated by 5.41 square kilometers (2.09 sq mi) or 0.38% of the provincial total and area.
Topography and slope
Topographic map of Cavite on 1 arc second/30-meter resolution
Situated at the entrance of Manila Bay, Cavite is characterized by rolling hinterlands punctuated by hills; shoreline fronting Manila Bay at sea level; and rugged portion at the boundary with Batangas where the Dos Picos mountains are located..The province has two mountain ranges.
Cavite is divided into four physiographical areas, namely: the lowest lowland area, lowland area, the central hilly area and the upland mountainous area.
The lowest lowland area is the coastal plain in particular..These areas have extremely low ground level of 0 to 2 m (0.0 to 6.6 ft) elevation compared to the high tide level of about 0.8 meters (2 ft 7 in) from the mean sea level (msl)..These are the cities of Cavite, Bacoor and the municipalities of Kawit, Noveleta, Rosario, northern part of Carmona and eastern part of Ternate.
The lowland area consists of the coastal and alluvial plains..These areas have flat ground slope of less than 0.5% and low ground elevation of 2 to 30 meters (6 ft 7 in to 98 ft 5 in)..The alluvial plain can be found in the city of Imus and southern part of General Trias..Into these municipalities forms the transition area between the coastal plain and the central hilly area..It also covers some areas of Bacoor, Carmona, Kawit, Noveleta, Rosario, and Tanza.
The third topography type is the central hilly area, generally found on the mountain foot slope..It forms the rolling tuffaceous plateau..This topography includes steep hills, ridges and elevated inland valley..The plateau is characterized with ground elevation ranging from 30 meters (98 ft) to nearly 400 meters (1,300 ft)..Its ground slope ranges from 0.5 to 2%..The cities of Trece Martires and Dasmariñas and the municipalities of General Emilio Aguinaldo, General Mariano Alvarez, western part of Ternate, northern parts of Amadeo, Indang, Silang, Magallanes and Maragondon have this kind of topography.
The last topography type is upland mountainous area, found in the city of Tagaytay and the municipalities of Alfonso, Mendez, southern parts of Amadeo, Indang, Silang, Magallanes and Maragondon..They are situated at a very high elevation above 400 meters (1,300 ft) with slopes of more than 2%..topped by rock formations that resembled horns (Sungay in Tagalog) hence the name..The prominence of the mountain was leveled in half during the construction of People's Park in the Sky during the Marcos administration.

Mounts Palay-Palay–Mataas-na-Gulod Protected Landscape
Cavite's land resources are categorized into two: forest lands and alienable and disposable lands..Forest lands are being maintained as they play a great role in the ecological balance of the province aside from the fact that they are home to numerous flora and fauna that needs to be protected and preserved..Correspondingly, the alienable and disposable lands are the built-up areas as well as production areas..These lands are intended for urban, economic and demographic developments.
Forest lands
Cavite province lies in the western monsoon forest zone..This location is very beneficial for the formation of tropical rainforests, which are characteristically made through natural vegetation..In 2007, the existing forest area within the province totaled only to 8,625 hectares (21,310 acres)..These forest areas were categorized as Protected Landscape under the National Integrated Protected Area System (NIPAS) and the rest, unclassified forest (Non-NIPAS)..A total of 4,000 hectares (9,900 acres) are located within the Mounts Palay-Palay–Mataas-na-Gulod Protected Landscape, a protected area in Ternate and Maragondon created by Proclamation Number 1594 on October 26, 1976..The park lies at the border of Cavite and Batangas and encompasses three peaks, Palay-Palay, Pico de Loro and Mataas na Gulod..The five unclassified forests are found along Tagaytay Ridge, Maragondon, Magallanes, Ternate and Alfonso..The other mountain peaks in the province are Mt..Buntis, Mt..Nagpatong, Mt..Hulog and Mt..Gonzales (Mt..Sungay).
Cavite's forest provides an abundance of different forest products..Bamboo, a member of the grass family, is one of the most available forest products found in the municipalities of Ternate, Magallanes, Maragondon and General Aguinaldo throughout the year.
Alienable and disposable lands
These lands are being used in various ways, either for agriculture, residences, open areas, etc..Based on the Cavite Provincial Physical Framework Plan 2005–2010, Cavite's alienable and disposable lands are further classified into production lands and built-up areas..Production lands in Cavite are intended for agriculture, fishery, and mining..On the other hand, built-up areas are mainly for residential areas, commercial, industrial and tourism areas.
Production land-use

Majority of production land-use is for agriculture..Considering that 50.33% of the total provincial land area is engaged in agriculture, it can be generalized that in spite of rapid urbanization in the province, Cavite remains to have an agricultural economy that makes food security attainable..Some of the major crops being produced in the province are rice, corn, coffee, coconuts, cut flowers and vegetables.
Included in the agricultural land use are livestock farms that range from piggery, poultry, goat and cattle farms..The climatic suitability of Cavite makes the province ideal for integrated farming, having crops and livestock raising in one farm.
Fishery is also another major component of the agricultural sector..Having rich marine resources and long coastlines, the province is home to numerous fishery activities providing livelihood to many Caviteños..In some lowland and even upland areas, fishery, in the form of fish ponds are also producing a large amount of fish products..Some areas in Cavite are also engaged in fish processing and production of fish products like fish sauce.
Mining is the third component of production land-use in the province..As of 2009, there are 15 mining and quarrying areas operating in Cavite..Extraction includes filling materials, gravel, and sand.
Built-up areas

The built-up areas are mainly composed of residential and industrial sites..This also includes commercial and business areas where commerce is transpiring..According to the 2007 Census of Population and Housing by the Philippine Statistics Authority, there are 611,450 occupied housing units in Cavite.
Moreover, according to the Housing and Land-Use Regulatory Board, there are around 1,224 housing subdivisions with issued license to sell in the province until 2009 which occupies an area of 9,471 hectares (23,400 acres).
Meanwhile, the industrial sector also develops rapidly in the province..For 2009, operational industrial estates cover around 2,939 hectares (7,260 acres)..Tourism establishments are also considered built-up areas such as golf courses, leisure farms, resorts and the likes.
Water resources

The hydrological network of the province is composed of seven major rivers and its tributaries..These river systems generally flows from the highlands of Tagaytay and Maragondon to Manila Bay..Numerous springs, waterfalls and rivers found in the upland areas of the province, have been developed for tourism..In the lowland areas, hundreds of artesian wells and deep wells provide water supply for both residential and irrigation purposes.
Cavite shoreline stretches about 123 kilometers (76 mi)..The communities located along the coast are Cavite City, Bacoor, Kawit, Noveleta, Rosario, Tanza, Naic, Maragondon, and Ternate..The richness of Cavite's coastal resources is a major producer of oysters and mussels..The fishing industry also produces shrimp and bangus (milkfish)..The western coastline are lined with pale gray sand beaches popular with tourists..Thus, fishery and tourism contribute to the economic activity of the province.

Cavite is composed of several soil types according to soil surveys conducted by the Bureau of Soils and Water Management (BSWM)..Classification of soil types in a specific area is a very important consideration in identifying its most fitted land-use..This way, utmost productivity can be achieved.
The lowland area of Cavite is generally composed of Guadalupe clay and clay loam..It is characterized as coarse and granular when dry but sticky and plastic when wet..Its substratum is solid volcanic tuff..These types of soils are suited to lowland rice and corn while those in the upland are suited for orchard and pasture..Guadalupe clay adobes are abundant in the southern part of Bacoor and Imus bordering Dasmariñas..The soil is hard and compact and difficult to cultivate that makes it generally unsuitable for diverse cropping..It is very sticky when wet and granular when dry..Forage grass is advised for this type of soil..Hydrosol and Obando sand are found along Bacoor Bay..The shoreline of Rosario, Tanza, Naic and Ternate are lined with Guadalupe sand.
The central area principally consists of Magallanes loam with streaks of Magallanes clay loam of sandy texture..This is recommended for diversified farming such as the cultivation of upland rice, corn, sugarcane, vegetables, coconut, coffee, mangoes and other fruit trees..The steep phase should be forested or planted to root crops..The eastern side of Cavite consists of Carmona clay loam with streaks of Carmona clay loam steep phase and Carmona sandy clay loam..This type of soil is granular with tuffaceous material and concretions..It is hard and compact when dry, sticky and plastic when wet..This type of soil is planted to rice with irrigation or sugarcane without irrigation..Fruit trees such as mango, avocado and citrus are also grown in this type of soil..Guingua fine sandy loam is found along the lower part of Malabon and Alang-ilang River at Noveleta.
The type of soils that dominate the upland areas are Tagaytay loam and Tagaytay sandy loam with mountain soil undifferentiated found on the south-eastern side bordering Laguna province..Also on the southern tip are Magallanes clay and Mountain soil undifferentiated with interlacing of Magallanes clay loam steep phase..The Tagaytay loam contains fine sandy materials, moderately friable, and easy to work on when moist..In an undisturbed condition, it bakes and becomes hard when dry..About one-half of this soil type is devoted to upland rice and upland crops..On the other hand, Tagaytay sandy loam is friable and granular with considerable amount of volcanic sand and underlain by adobe clay..Mountain soil undifferentiated is forested with bamboos found in the sea coast..Cavite also has the Patungan sand characterized by pale gray to almost white sand with substratum of marine conglomerates which are found at Santa Mercedes in Maragondon and in some coastlines of Ternate.
Mineral resources and reserves
The greater parts of Cavite are composed of volcanic materials, tuff, cinders, basalt, breccias, agglomerate and interbeddings of shales, and sandstones..The dormant and active volcanoes (Taal) are within these volcanic areas and have been the sources of volcanic materials which form the Tagaytay Cuesta..The drainage systems are deeply entrenched in the tuffs, eroding thin interbedded sandstones and conglomerate rocks which are the sources of little reserves of sand and gravel in the larger stream..Adobe stone quarries also flourish in the tuff areas.
Cavite coastal areas have marl and conglomerate sedimentary rocks and some igneous rocks which are prominent in the high, mountainous regions of western part of the province..Black sands are found in Kawit while Noveleta has its own salt products..Magallanes has gravel deposits while reserves of sand and gravel materials are found in Alfonso, Carmona, Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo, Naic, Ternate, Maragondon and Silang.

Other faiths
Non-Abrahamic faiths include native Tagalog anitism, animism, Sikhism, and Hinduism..Among the local Chinese and Chinese-Filipino communities, Taoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism are followed.
Languages
The main languages spoken are Tagalog, Chavacano and English, while the former is also utilized with native Cavite dialect that has variants in every municipality of the province..Due to the cities of Metro Manila bordering Cavite to the south, a large number of people from farther provinces have migrated to Cavite, resulting in minor but significant usage of the Bicolano, Cebuano, Ilocano, Hiligaynon, Kapampangan, Waray, Maranao, Maguindanaon and Tausug languages.
Chavacano in Cavite
Chavacano or Chabacano is a Spanish-based creole language and known in linguistics as Philippine Creole Spanish..Chabacano is originally spoken by the majority of the Caviteños that lived in Cavite City and Ternate after the arrival of the Spaniards three centuries ago..The various groups in the area of different linguistic backgrounds adopted a pidgin language, with mostly Spanish vocabulary, in order to communicate with each other..As children grew up in Cavite with that pidgin as their native language, it evolved into a creole language.
Now used almost exclusively in Cavite City and coastal Ternate, Chabacano enjoyed its widest diffusion and greatest splendor in Spanish and American period of Filipino history, when newspapers and literary outputs flourished..Cavite Chabacano was spoken with relative ease because it was essentially a simplification of Castillan morphology patterned after the Tagalog syntax..Gradually and naturally, it acquired the sounds present in the Spanish phonological system..After World War II, creole Spanish speakers within the capital of the archipelago vanished..Around 30,000 Caviteños still speak Chabacano, mostly elderly speakers..The language is today taught in elementary schools in both Cavite City and Ternate as part of the K-12 national curriculum from the first to 3rd grades, building up a new generation of speakers and writers within the province.

Agriculture
Rice plantation in Carmona
The province is predominantly an agriculture province..The province's economy is largely dependent on agriculture..Despite urbanization and industrialization, still, a significant number of inhabitants are engaged into agribusinesses..The data gathered from Office of the Provincial Agriculturist shows that though the province lies in the industrial belt, the agricultural land is about 49.38% or 70,466.53 hectares (174,126.6 acres) of the total land area of the Province..This is 1,176.5 hectares (2,907 acres) bigger than that of the declared agricultural lands in 2008 (69,290.03 hectares or 171,219.4 acres).
The municipality of Maragondon has the biggest area intended for agriculture, accounts for 14.57% of the total provincial agricultural lands while Cavite City has no longer available land for agriculture related activities and industries..If based on total agricultural lands, we may say that the major players in agriculture in the province are Maragondon, Silang, Indang, Naic and Alfonso..Of the eight districts in the province, the top three with the widest agricultural area are 7th District comprising 43,587.01 hectares (107,705.8 acres) or 61.85% of the total agricultural areas with 27,115 farmers followed by 6th District with 17.40% or 12,257.71 hectares (30,289.5 acres) having 8,701 farmers and 5th District comprising 10,248.55 hectares (25,324.7 acres) with 10,295 farmers..The municipality of Silang has the most farmers..The municipality of Maragondon only ranks 3rd in terms of number of farmers..This can be attributed to highly mechanized operations and vast plantations of rice..The same is true with General Trias and Naic, known as the rice producing municipalities in Cavite..The number of farmers increased by 6.5% that corresponds to around 3,097 farmers..The increase in the number of farmers was due to worldwide recession which led to work displacement of some inhabitants..Silang is dominated by pineapple and coffee plantations as well as with cut flower production.
Industry and commerce
Cavite has twelve economic zones..The largest economic zone under development is located in General Trias, the PEC Industrial Park with 177 hectares (440 acres) intended for garments, textiles, semiconductors, food processing and pharmaceuticals.

There are twenty-two accredited tourism establishments and three accredited tour guides..There are also tour packages being arranged with the Department of Tourism..Centuries old traditions and the very rich culture of Cavite have been the source of great pride to Caviteños.
Transportation
During the Spanish colonial period, Cavite hosted the principal port of Manila and served as the country's gateway to the world.
In the mid-19th century, Cavite, particularly the Cavite Peninsula in the north, was a stop for ships from South America before free trade opened up.
Roads
Aguinaldo Highway, shown with Philippine flags, is one of the main highways in the province
Kaybiang Tunnel
Cavite's total road network comprises roughly 1,973 kilometers (1,226 mi)..Of these, the 407.7-kilometer (253.3 mi) national roads are mostly paved with concrete or asphalt and are relatively in good condition with some portions in need of rehabilitation..Provincial roads stretches to an approximate total length of 335.1 kilometers (208.2 mi)..Most of these roads are concrete, some are paved with asphalt and the rest remain gravel roads..Majority of the municipal/city roads are paved with concrete, while barangay roads consist of 46.7% concrete and asphalt roads and 53.3% earth and gravel roads.
There are three main highways traversing the province: Aguinaldo Highway runs in a general north–south direction which includes the Tagaytay–Nasugbu Highway segment in the south; the Governor's Drive runs in a general east–west direction; the Antero Soriano Highway runs within the coastal towns on the northwest..The existing road length computed in terms of road density with respect to population at the standard of 2.4 kilometers (1.5 mi) per 1,000 population has a deficit of 3,532.71 kilometers (2,195.12 mi).
In 1985, the tolled Cavite Expressway (CAVITEX) was opened, which lessened the heavy volume of vehicles on Aguinaldo Highway in Bacoor..This project decreased the traffic congestion in Aguinaldo Highway in Bacoor, so travel time from Imus to Baclaran/Pasay is lessened to only one hour.
In 2013, the Kaybiang Tunnel, the country's longest underground highway tunnel at 300 meters (980 ft) was opened along the Ternate–Nasugbu Road piercing through Mt..Pico De Loro's north ridge, and shortens the travel time from Manila to the western coves of Cavite and Nasugbu, Batangas.
Currently, Cavite province is served by three Department of Public Works and Highways offices: Cavite 1st, Cavite 2nd and Cavite Sub District Engineering Offices.
Proposed/ongoing transportation projects
Sangley International Airport
The Department of Transportation had ""no objection"" to an offer building a ₱508-billion airport complex on reclaimed land in Sangley Point..The upcoming international airport was pursued as a joint venture between investors, including Chinese enterprises, and the Cavite LGU.
Cavite–Laguna and Cavite–Tagaytay–Batangas Expressways
Cavite–Laguna Expressway in Silang
The Cavite–Laguna Expressway (CALAX) is an under-construction expressway that will cross the provinces of Cavite and Laguna in the Philippines..The construction of the four-lane 47-kilometer (29 mi) long expressway will connect CAVITEx in Kawit to South Luzon Expressway in Biñan, Laguna..When constructed, it is expected to ease the traffic in the Cavite–Laguna region, particularly in Aguinaldo Highway, Santa Rosa–Tagaytay Road and Governor's Drive..As of 2024, it is partially operational from Biñan to Silang, Cavite.
Cavite–Tagaytay–Batangas Expressway is also a proposed expressway connects with CALAX from Silang, Cavite to Nasugbu, Batangas..CTBEx is a future alternative route for tourists going to Tagaytay and Nasugbu.
LRT Line 1 Cavite Extension Project
The LRT Line 1 South Extension Project, or Cavite Extension Project, through southern Metro Manila to the Province of Cavite has been identified as an integral link of the Rail Transit Network by the Metro Manila Urban Transportation Integration Study (MMUTIS), and the extension project was originally planned as the first litratation of Line 6 in the 1990s..It is one of the priority projects of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC, now the Department of Transportation) and LRTA..It is also a flagship project of the Office of the President.
The project aims to expand the existing LRT Line 1 service southward to the cities of Parañaque, Las Piñas and the city of Bacoor in Cavite..The 11.7-kilometer (7.3 mi) route of the light railway system that will start from Baclaran to Niog was planned to carry a capacity of 40,000 passengers per direction per hour..The groundbreaking of LRT Line 1 South Extension Project was held on May 4, 2017..The actual construction officially started on May 7, 2019 because the Right-of-way is ""free and clear"" from obstructions..Once it is fully operational, Cavite will be served by the LRT-1 (via Niog station)..The extension is slated for partial operations by late 2024 and full operations by second quarter of 2031..This is the one of the three rapid transit line project outside Metro Manila..The said project will serve approximately 1.9 million commuters based in Pasay, Parañaque, Las Piñas, and Bacoor.
LRT Line 6 Project
The proposed LRT Line 6 project would further extend the LRT system by another 19 kilometers all the way to Dasmariñas from the proposed end in Niog in Bacoor, Cavite.
The mass transit system would pass along the Aguinaldo Highway and would have stations in Niog, Tirona station, Imus station, Daang Hari station, Salitran station, Congressional Avenue station, and Governor's Drive station..The project will improve passenger mobility and reduce the volume of vehicular traffic in the Cavite area by providing a higher capacity mass transit system..It also aims to spur economic development along the extension corridor.
When the original project was shelved in 2018, a similar proposal was submitted by Prime Asset Ventures Inc., and its chairman, Manny Villar, proposed a 47.2-kilometer railway system that links the southern Metro Manila to the major cities in Cavite.

^ (Page 10) Pérez, Marilola (2015)..Cavite Chabacano Philippine Creole Spanish: Description and Typology (PDF) (PhD)..University of California, Berkeley..Archived from the original on January 14, 2021..The galleon activities also attracted a great number of Mexican men that arrived from the Mexican Pacific coast as ships' crewmembers (Grant 2009: 230)..Mexicans were administrators, priests and soldiers (guachinangos or hombres de pueblo) (Bernal 1964: 188) many though, integrated into the peasant society, even becoming tulisanes 'bandits' who in the late 18th century ""infested"" Cavite and led peasant revolts (Medina 2002: 66)..Meanwhile, in the Spanish garrisons, Spanish was used among administrators and priests..Nonetheless, there is not enough historical information on the social role of these men..In fact some of the few references point to a quick integration into the local society: ""los hombres del pueblo, los soldados y marinos, anónimos, olvidados, absorbidos en su totalidad por la población Filipina."".(Bernal 1964: 188)..In addition to the Manila-Acapulco galleon, a complex commercial maritime system circulated European and Asian commodities including slaves..During the 17th century, Portuguese vessels traded with the ports of Manila and Cavite, even after the prohibition of 1644 (Seijas 2008: 21)..Crucially, the commercial activities included the smuggling and trade of slaves: ""from the Moluccas, and Malacca, and India… with the monsoon winds"" carrying ""clove spice, cinnamon, and pepper and black slaves, and Kafir "" (Antonio de Morga cf Seijas 2008: 21)."".Though there is no data on the numbers of slaves in Cavite, the numbers in Manila suggest a significant fraction of the population had been brought in as slaves by the Portuguese vessels..By 1621, slaves in Manila numbered 1,970 out of a population of 6,110..This influx of slaves continued until late in the 17th century; according to contemporary cargo records in 1690, 200 slaves departed from Malacca to Manila (Seijas 2008: 21)..Different ethnicities were favored for different labor; Africans were brought to work on the agricultural production, and skilled slaves from India served as caulkers and carpenters.

Province in Central Visayas, Philippines
This article is about the province in the Philippines..For its capital city, see Cebu City..For the city in Malaysia, see Sibu.
For other uses, see Cebu (disambiguation).
This article or section may need to be rewritten to comply with Wikipedia's quality standards, as it uses Bisaya Patronymesis Sri Visjaya, Aginid, Bayok sa Atong Tawarik, and History of Panay from the first inhabitants and the Bornean immigrants from which the Bisayans are descended to the Arrival of the Spaniards as sources—all three have been proven hoaxes, as well as Macachor and Montebon's works, which greatly source from the former three..The page is possibly written with propaganda intent or advertisement..

Cebu (/sɛˈbuː/ seb-OO; Cebuano: Sugbo), officially the Province of Cebu (Cebuano: Lalawigan sa Sugbo; Hiligaynon: Kapuoran sang Cebu; Filipino: Lalawigan ng Cebu), is a province of the Philippines located in the Central Visayas (Region VII) region, and consists of a main island and 167 surrounding islands and islets..The coastal zone of Cebu is identified as a site of highest marine biodiversity importance in the Coral Triangle.
Its capital and largest city is Cebu City, nicknamed ""the Queen (Catholic) City of the South"" having the Second Cardinal, the oldest city and first capital of the Philippines, which is politically independent from the provincial government along with Mandaue and Lapu-Lapu City..The Cebu Metropolitan Area or Metro Cebu is the third largest metropolitan area in the Philippines (after Metro Manila and Metro Davao) with Cebu City as the main center of commerce, trade, education and industry in the Visayas..Being one of the most developed provinces in the Philippines, in a decade it has transformed into a global hub for business processing services, tourism, shipping, furniture-making, and heavy industry..Mactan–Cebu International Airport, located on Mactan Island, is the second busiest airport in the Philippines.
Cebu has the most combined cities and municipalities of any province in the Philippines, with 53 in total.
Etymology
It is unclear whether the island was named sugbó or the settlement where Ferdinand Magellan's crew arrived in 1521..The capital city of the province is also named Cebu City.
The name is possibly derived from a hypothetical Proto-Philippine word *sug(e)bu meaning ""to bathe"" or ""to wade into the water""..In fact, there is also another municipality in Batangas, Philippines called Nasugbu, which may also share the same etymological root with the said province.
The modern name is most likely how the first Europeans heard of the name of the place in the 16th-17th centuries, as it was first recorded as Zubu or Çubu, and then eventually it became Cebu..The reason of the spelling change is because Visayans were mostly illiterate in the 16th and 17th centuries.

Report from the Magellan expedition
The arrival of Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in 1521 began a period of Spanish exploration and colonization.
Losing the favor of King Manuel I of Portugal for his plan of reaching the Spice Islands by sailing west from Europe, Magellan offered his services to King Charles I of Spain (Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor)..On September 20, 1519, Magellan led five ships with a total complement of 250 people from the Spanish fort of Sanlúcar de Barrameda en route to southeast Asia via the Americas and the Pacific Ocean..They reached the Philippines on March 16, 1521..Rajah Kolambu the king of Mazaua told them to sail for Cebu, where they could trade and obtain provisions.
Arriving in Cebu City, Magellan, with Enrique of Malacca as a translator, befriended Rajah Humabon a chief of a village in Cebu, and persuaded the natives to ally themselves with the Spanish..On April 14 Magellan erected a large wooden cross on the shores of Cebu..Afterward, Humabon was baptized along with about 400 islanders.
Magellan soon heard of Datu Lapu-Lapu, a native chief in nearby Mactan Island, a rival of a chief in Cebu..It was thought that Humabon and Lapu–Lapu had been fighting for control of the flourishing trade in the area..On April 27 the Battle of Mactan occurred, where the Spaniards were defeated and Magellan was killed by the natives of Mactan in Mactan Island..According to Italian historian and chronicler Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan's body was never recovered despite efforts to trade for it with spice and jewels..Magellan's second-in-command, Juan Sebastián Elcano, took his place as captain of the expedition and sailed the fleet back to Spain, circumnavigating the world.
Depiction of the Bisayan tattooed men, known then as timawa in the Boxer Codex (c. 1590)..Cebu was one of the islands referred where ""painted people"" (referring to the tattoos) resided.
Survivors of the Magellan expedition returned to Spain with tales of a savage island in the East Indies..Consequently, several Spanish expeditions were sent to the islands but all ended in failure.
Report from the Legazpi expedition
On April 27,1565 Miguel López de Legazpi arrived on the island (some sources say on 1564 CE), though he also intended to make peace, he was also prepared for a war since these were the same people that killed Magellan 44 years prior..According to the report, a messenger went to the Spanish ship and informed them that Tupas and ""along with 10 other chiefs"" would be out to either make negotiations or as a warning to prepare for an upcoming battle..Despite trying to assure the natives that the Spanish were there with good intentions, the natives already armed themselves, both parties were reported to have taunted each other offshore..Legazpi aimed the artillery on the proas which briefly confused the opposing natives causing them to run into the woods thus making the shore clear for the Spanish to land..Salvaging any valuable item that could be found, Juan de Camuz came across an image of the Child Jesus, which was probably the one Magellan presented to the consort of the chief in 1521..From then on, a church was built on the site which would later become the Minor Basilica of the Holy Child..Twelve days later, on May 8, a fort was established and while the construction was ongoing, the natives frequently launched attacks but were always repulsed until eventually they give in as soon as they realized the superior armament of the Europeans..Legazpi dealt only with Tupas, after a brief ""trial"" on grounds of apostasy and Magellan's murder, the Europeans pardoned the natives' chief and included the natives..After the exchange, the two parties then discussed the terms and conditions including confirmation of titles, who receives tax exemptions, land grants, authority and recognition of officials..The crew then left Cebu on June 1, 1565.: 113
American Colonial Period
In 1898, the island was ceded to the United States after the Spanish–American War and Philippine–American War..In 1901, Cebu was governed by the United States for a brief period, however, it became a chartered city on February 24, 1937, and was governed independently by Filipino politicians.
Japanese Occupation Period
Cebu, being one of the most densely populated islands in the Philippines, served as a Japanese base during their occupation in World War II which began with the landing of Japanese soldiers in April 1942..A Japanese businessman established Cebu's first ""comfort station"" during the war, where Japanese soldiers routinely gang-raped, humiliated, and murdered kidnapped girls and teenagers who they forced into sexual slavery under the brutal ""comfort women"" system..which is said to have changed the American plans to retake the Philippines from Japanese occupation in 1944, by helping the combined United States and the Philippine Commonwealth Army forces enter Cebu in 1945..The following year the island achieved independence from colonial rule in 1946.
Philippine independence
During the Marcos dictatorship
Cebu became a key center of resistance against the Marcos dictatorship,
Among the Cebuanos immediately arrested by the Marcos dictatorship when Martial law was announced on September 23, 1972, were columnist and future National Artist Resil Mojares and human rights lawyer and Carcar Vice Mayor Democrito Barcenas, who were both detained at Camp Sergio Osmeña.
One of the Marcos Martial Law Desaparecidos from Cebu was Redemptorist Priest Fr..Rudy Romano,
Role in the People Power Revolution
Later, Cebu would play a key role in the days leading up to the 1986 People Power revolution and the ouster of Marcos..It was from Fuente Osmeña circle in Cebu City that the opposition forces relaunched the Civil Disobedience Campaign against the Marcos regime and its cronies on February 22, 1986..After that, the Carmelite Monastery in Barangay Mabolo, Cebu City, served as a refuge for opposition candidates Corazon Aquino and Salvador Laurel during the first day of the People Power revolution, because it was not yet safe to go back to Manila.
Contemporary
In 2007, the municipalities of Bogo, Carcar, and Naga became component cities..Their respective cityhood laws were ratified in the same year..However, their cityhood status were lost twice in the years 2008 and 2010 after the LCP questioned the validity of the cityhood laws..Their cityhood status were reaffirmed after the court finalized its ruling on February 15, 2011 declared their respective cityhood laws constitutional.
In February 2012 Cebu island experienced the effects of magnitude 6.7 earthquake on the neighboring island of Negros and was the largest quake in the area for 90 years..The tremor shook buildings but there were no reports of major building damage or loss of life on Cebu Island itself..This tremor was caused by a previously unrecorded fault.
In October 2013, Cebu and Bohol were hit by record-setting 7.2 magnitude earthquake which left 222 dead and collapsed some buildings, including 5 historical churches.
In December 2021, Typhoon Rai wreaked havoc across the province,

Cebu is located to the east of Negros, to the west of Leyte and Bohol islands..The province consists of Cebu Island, as well as 167 smaller islands, which include Mactan, Bantayan, Malapascua, Olango and the Camotes Islands..But the highly urbanized cities of Cebu, Lapu-Lapu and Mandaue are independent cities not under provincial supervision, yet are often grouped with the province for geographical and statistical purposes.
The province's land area is 4,944 square kilometers (1,909 sq mi), or when the three independent cities (Cebu City, Lapu-Lapu and Mandaue) are included for geographical purposes, the total area is 5,342 square kilometers (2,063 sq mi).
Cebu's central location, proximity to an unusually exotic tourist destination, ready access to a diversity of plant, animal and geological wonders within the island, and remoteness from earthquake and typhoon activity are some of the special attributes of Cebu.
Cebu Island
Cebu island satellite image captured by Sentinel-2 in 2016
Cebu Island is the 126th largest island in the world..Cebu Island itself is long and narrow, stretching 196 kilometers (122 mi) from north to south and 32 kilometers (20 mi) across at its widest point..It has narrow coastlines, limestone plateaus, and coastal plains..It also has rolling hills and rugged mountain ranges traversing the northern and southern lengths of the island.
Cebu's highest mountains are over 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) high..Flat tracts of land can be found in the city of Bogo and in the towns of San Remigio, Medellin and Daanbantayan at the northern region of the province.
The island's area is 4,468 square kilometres (1,725 sq mi),
Beaches, coral atolls, islands, and rich fishing grounds surround Cebu.
Coal was first discovered in Cebu about 1837..There were 15 localities over the whole island, on both coasts; some desultory mining had been carried out Naga near Mount Uling, but most serious operations were at Licos and Camansi west of Compostela and Danao..The Compostela-Danao coalfield contained about six million workable tons..The tramroads, one from Danao to Camansi, one from Compostela to Mount Licos, were undertaken in 1895, together with a wagon road built in 1877, from Cotcot to Dapdap.
Climate
Main article: Climate of Cebu
The climate of Cebu is tropical..There are 2 seasons in Cebu − the dry and wet season..It is dry and sunny most of the year with some occasional rains during the months of June to December..The province of Cebu normally gets typhoons once a year or none.
Northern Cebu gets more rainfall and typhoons than southern Cebu because it has a different climate..Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) hit Northern Cebu in 2013 killing 73 people and injuring 348 others..Though most typhoons hit only the northern part of Cebu, the urban areas in central Cebu are sometimes hit, such as when Typhoon Mike (Ruping), one of the worst to hit Cebu lashed the central Cebu area in 1990..31 years later, Typhoon Rai struck the central and southern portions of the province.
Cebu's temperatures can reach a high of 36 °C (97 °F) from March to May, and as low as 18 °C (64 °F) in the mountains during the wet season..The average temperature is around 24 to 34 °C (75 to 93 °F), and does not fluctuate much except during the month of May, which is the hottest month..Cebu averages 70–80% humidity.
Fauna
See also: List of amphibians and reptiles of CebuCopsychus cebuensis, the Black Shama (locally called Siloy), is a species of Shama bird that is only found in the island of Cebu..It is currently endangered..It has been observed as far in urban areas as Cebu City, but is mainly abundant in the species' last stronghold, the Nug-as rainforest of Alcoy..It can also be found in Casili, Consolacion and the mountainous areas of the Trans Central Highway..The bird was once featured on the official stamp of Cebu of 1992.Endemic species in Cebu include the Cebu Flowerpecker (Dicaeum quadricolor), Cebu Slender Skink (Brachymeles cebuensis), Uling Goby (Sicyopus cebuensis), and Black Shama (Copsychus cebuensis).
There is also a subspecies of Idea leuconoe that is only endemic to Cebu..I. l. jumaloni is endemic to the area of Kawasan Falls in Badian, hence its common name, the Kawasan Paper Kite Butterfly..The subspecies is also named after Julian Jumalon, a Cebuano Lepidopterist and butterfly artist..The butterfly can also be observed in the Nug-as rainforest.
Flora
Cebu has little remaining forest cover..The remaining forest patches in Cebu are composed primarily of the following tree species.
Mount Lantoy: Carallia brachiata and introduced species Tectona grandis, Swietenia macrophylla, Gmelina arborea, and Casuarina equisetifolia
Palinipinon Mountains: Carallia brachiata and introduced species Swietenia macrophylla
Nug-as forest: Ficus spp., Artocarpus blancoi, Macaranga grandifolia, and Cinnamomum cebuense
Mount Lanaya: Carallia brachiata
Mount Tabunan: Trevesia burckii, Voacanga globosa, Heptapleurum actinophyllum, Pouteria villamilii, and Palaquium luzoniense
Administrative divisions

Cebu City, although independent from Cebu Province (together with Mandaue and Lapu-Lapu City), is the largest city and economic hub of the island.
""Ceboom"", a combination of Cebu and boom, has been used to describe the province's economic development..With many beautiful islands, white sand beaches, luxury hotels and resorts, diving locations and heritage sites, high domestic and foreign tourist arrivals have fueled the tourism industry of Cebu..Cebu consistently gets a big share of tourist arrivals in the Philippines and has become the tourist gateway to Central and Southern Philippines due to its central geographic location, accessibility, and natural resources..The province also hosts various national and international conferences every year.
About 80% of domestic and international shipping operators and shipbuilders in the Philippines are located in Cebu..Shipbuilding companies in Cebu have manufactured bulk carriers of up to 70,000 tonnes deadweight (DWT), and double-hulled fastcraft as well..Cebu's industry helps make the Philippines the 5th largest shipbuilding country in the world.
Cebu's extensive port facilities and its proximity to intra-Asian shipping and air routes are major factors which led multinational companies to establish offices or factories on the main island, as well as in the island of Mactan, where they are clustered in special economic zones known as the Mactan Economic Processing Zone 1 (MEPZ-1) and the Mactan Economic Processing Zone 2 (MEPZ-2)..Due to its burgeoning furniture-making industry, Cebu has been named as the furniture capital of the Philippines..Cebu's other exports include: fashion accessories, guitars, coconut, coconut oil, dried mangoes, carrageenan, gifts, toys, watches, cameras, electronic components, and housewares.
With a revenue growth rate of 18.8 percent in 2012, the real estate industry is the fastest-growing sector in Cebu..With the strong economic indicators and high investors' confidence level, more condominium projects and hypermarkets are being developed in the locality..An additional 100 commercial and residential buildings would be completed by 2015 and another 170 to 200 buildings are expected to be finished by 2017..64 new hypermarkets will be developed in Cebu.
In 2013, Cebu ranked 8th worldwide in the ""Top 100 BPO Destinations Report"" by global advisory firm, Tholons.

Significant dates
One of the Passus of the Good Friday procession of the Semana Santa of Bantayan showing St. Longinus piercing the side of the Body of Christ..Bantayan's Holy Week processions and practices are said to be the grandest in the Visayas..Bantayan is also the only town in the Philippines where fasting is not strictly observed during Holy Week.
Cebu Provincial Charter Day
The province celebrates its charterhood August 6th each year..It is considered a special non-working holiday throughout the entire province, including the three independent city states.
During the monthly celebration of Cebu's provincial charterhood, the province hosts a variety of events in line with the aim for unity among all Cebuanos..As part of the Founding Anniversary Celebration of the province, the capitol hosts the Tabo sa Kapitolyo, a provincial trade fair that features all the products, delicacies, and other specialties from each City and Municipality in the province..The province also hosts the Pasigarbo sa Sugbo Festival of Festivals, a celebration that showcases all festivals from every town of Cebu and is meant to highlight the culture, history, traditions, and way of life of all Cebuanos.
Semana Santa sa Bantayan
The Semana Santa of Bantayan is the local Holy Week celebration in the town of Bantayan..It is largely considered the grandest celebration of Holy Week in the Visayas..The celebration features lifelike Passus depicting the Passion and Death of Jesus on top of intricate caroes that are paraded throughout the entire town.
One thing that makes the Holy Week and Lenten Celebration of Bantayan unique from other Holy Week observations of other parts of Cebu and the Philippines (and, quite possibly, the world) is that traditional Lenten Fast is not strictly observed during Holy Week..This is because the town of Bantayan has received an exemption from the traditional Lenten fast directly from the Vatican..The exemption or special permission dated July 27, 1824, which is formally known as “Bantayan Indult”, was signed by Pope Leo XII himself..The Bantayan Indult was given through Padre Doroteo Andrada Del Rosario and allows the consumption of meat on days of fasting and obligation..The original document is being kept at the Bantayan Museum in Bantayan Island.
There are several speculations as to why the town made the request for an indult..The most probable reason for having this indult is because people in the town would usually avoid fishing during Holy Week..This is likely because, at the time, all forms of work was prohibited, including fishing and aquaculture..Without anyone supplying fish, the only allowed meat for fasting, to the town, the Bantayanons were left with no choice but to eat the meat that is normally prohibited in Lent..There is also another reason for this based on folk beliefs..Because of the local belief that evil powers and malignant entities are stronger during Good Friday, the day of the death of Jesus, the fishermen of the town would deem it too unsafe to fish, in fear that an evil presence will come upon them at sea.
In truth, the indult has long expired and is no longer valid, however, Bantayanons today still practice eating the usually forbidden meat during Holy Week as it has already become part of their Lenten traditions.
Gabii sa Kabilin
Translating to ""Heritage Night"", it is a program initiated by the Ramon Aboitiz Foundation Incorporated in 2007..Gabii sa Kabilin is an event that aims to help preserve Cebu's rich history, culture and heritage, by encouraging the public to visit the different museums and heritage structures of Cebu..For one night, all the museums and heritage structures of Cebu all open their doors for all people in order for them to learn about the history of Cebu, as well as its heritage and cultural legacy..Although most of the heritage locations that participate in the heritage night are from Cebu City, there are also other locations that are from the other parts of the province..Museo Sugbo, the provincial museum, and the National Museum of the Philippines of Cebu are among the participating museums of Gabii sa Kabilin.
Festivals
Sinulog
Main article: Sinulog
Sinulog's annual maritime procession.

The Sinulog Festival is the largest fiesta (festival) in the Philippines..Held every third Sunday of January, it commemorates the Child Jesus (Santo Niño), the Lord and Protector of Cebu..The Sinulog is a dance ritual of pre-Hispanic indigenous origin..The dancer moves two steps forward and one step backward to the rhythmic sound of drums..This movement resembles the current (sulog) of what was then known as Cebu's Pahina River..Thus the name Sinulog.
The Sinulog Festival celebration lasts for nine days, culminating on the final day with the Sinulog Grand Parade..The day before the parade, the Fluvial Procession is held at dawn with a statue of the Santo Niño carried on a pump boat from Mandaue City to Cebu City, decked with hundreds of flowers and candles..The procession ends at the Basilica where a re-enactment of the Christianization of the Philippines on the island of Cebu is performed..In the afternoon, a more solemn procession takes place along the major streets of the city, which last for hours due to large crowds participating in the event.
When the Spaniards arrived in Cebu, the Italian chronicler, Antonio Pigafetta, sailing under convoy with the Magellan expedition, offered the wooden figure of the Santo Niño as a baptismal gift to Hara Amihan, wife of Rajah Humabon who was named Juana after her baptism together with the Rajah, who was also renamed, Carlos..Juana, together with the natives, according to tradition, danced and worshipped the Santo Niño de Cebu in their indigenous Sinulog dance ritual..
In the province, the festival is shared by both Cebu City and Carmen..The festival is said to have originated in Carmen and was once a localized version of the Ati-atihan Festival introduced by Jose Motos, the then rector of the Parish of St. Augustine, the town parish of Carmen, but was then changed to ""Sinulog sa Carmen"" after Sinulog became an established Cebuano festival..The Sinulog dance was first introduced to Cebu City by a woman named Estelita Diola, who would otherwise be referred to as ""Titang Diola""..Her family was skilled with the original form of the dance of Sinulog and the tradition was eventually passed on to her by her father..Because of her great contribution and propagation of the Sinulog dance of Cebu, she was referred to as the ""Heritage Keeper""..The original Sinulog dance and her legacy of devotion to the Child Jesus through dancing continues today even after her death and is still continued through her former students who now teach the youth of Cebu the original dance moves of Sinulog..Sinulog had since very much diversified from the original dance of Titang Diola..Today we can see the Sinulog danced every day at the Basilica Minore del Santo Niño performed by the candle vendors..The version they perform is called ""Sinug"" and is only for worship and prayer to bless the candles for prayers to the Holy Child..The Sinulog Festival dance performed by contingents in the City Sports Center is still religious and devotional since dancers often include personal supplications, petitions, thanksgivings, intercessions, or any other prayers in their dance for the Child Jesus and their dance performances in street dance and ritual showdown are still centered on the Holy Child..There are mainly two types of Sinulog dances performed in the festival, namely the ""Sinulog-Based Category"" and the ""Free Interpretation Category""..The Sinulog-Based Category refers to the Sinulog dance based on the Church Sinulog performed by candle vendors while the Free Interpretation Category refers to the Sinulog dance interpreted in any way, outside Church Sinulog, for as long as it is acceptable in the festival..In recent years, the festival gained commercialization which made the festival and Cebu popular, but unfortunately lessened the religious nature of the festival..Despite the extreme commercialization of the festival, Sinulog still remains to be a religious festival for the faithful..Sinulog still remains to be a dance of prayer..The festival is officially governed by the Sinulog Foundation Incorporated (SFI)..The foundation maintains that, although Sinulog has largely become mainstream, it remains a religious festival because at the heart of the Sinulog is the Santo Niño..The foundation has made this point clear in many instances, such as the correction of the wrongful term ""Sinulog Grand Mardi Gras"" to ""Sinulog Grand Parade"" as the focus was not on the fanfare but the worship to the Child Jesus.
In the 1980s and 2000s, the city authorities of Cebu added the religious feast of Santo Niño de Cebu during the Sinulog Festival to its cultural event..Despite being a religious festival and a Christian festival, Sinulog has come to be a celebration for all Cebuanos and Filipinos regardless of their faith and practices..Aside from its religious nature, Sinulog has also become renowned for its street parties..In 2012, Cebu introduced Life Dance, the biggest outdoor dance party in the Philippines..The Sinulog street parties are considered a major attraction for youth individuals but, in most cases for most people, particularly the faithful, a growing problem that threatens the religiosity and solemnity of the festival..In 2016, the festival had the worst recorded case of a stampede wherein large groups of people, both worshippers and drunken party-goers, were congested in the uptown area, with no passable exit routes and virtually no crowd control up until midnight and with one recorded case of a teenage woman losing consciousness because of cramped spaces..Due to this incident, the then Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osmeña enforced a strict liquor ban in the following festivals during his term to ensure the safety of the worshippers and spectators and to maintain the solemnity of the celebration.
The festival was halted for two years (2021 - 2022)..In 2021, the main reason for halting the festival was because of the COVID-19 pandemic..The Vice Mayor of Cebu at the time, Michael Rama, who was the-then chairperson of the SFI, insisted on having a Sinulog Festival that year, despite health concerns from health experts and the police from Cebu City..This came shortly after Cebu City's then Mayor, the late Edgardo Labella, dissolving the Sinulog Governing Body (SGB), which Rama protested against through his resignation from the foundation, and reinstating him as chairperson of the SFI..Rama cited that the venue of that year's supposed festival was at the parking lot of SM Seaside City Cebu and would be in a ""bubble environment"" without a live audience..He even went as far as to limit the number of dancers and the propsmen..He continued to insist on holding the festival, largely against the behest of the Cebuanos..Various health workers and police officials stated that even though the dancers were isolated, the fact that there were multiple individuals gathering in a closed environment, and in close contact with each other, was already a ""direct violation of the health protocols""..This also included the gathering of dancers during their practices..As a result, several dancers from various contingents in Cebu City tested positive for COVID-19 and most of the infected individuals showed the common symptoms..This led to Rama officially retracting his movement for Sinulog 2021..However, the other minor related competitions of the Sinulog, such as the Search for the Sinulog Festival Queen were still pushed through..The festival was slated for a comeback in 2022, but was again cancelled due to the aftermath of Super Typhoon Odette, which ravaged Cebu and nearby islands..Sinulog eventually was celebrated again in 2023, but was met with controversy..Rama, who is currently the mayor of Cebu City, decided to move the festival from its usual venue at the Cebu City Sports Complex to Citi di Mare at the South Road Properties..This was met with flak by the Cebuanos as, not only was the Sports Complex the established venue of the festival, but also because the festival was to be moved to a major road that is an important passageway for travellers going from the North to the South and back..Initially, the provincial governor, Gwendolyn Garcia, was not against the move to change the venue of the Sinulog, but immediately changed her mind after she had seen pictures from a newspaper photographer of provincial Sinulog contingents having blockings for their dances in the new venue for the Sinulog which was deeply covered in mud and was completely unfinished..Feeling pity for the dancers, she made the decision to remove the provincial contingents from the grand parade, unless Rama would return the festival to the old venue..Unfortunately, Rama continued insisting on having the Sinulog in SRP and the festival was indeed pushed through in the new venue without the provincial contingents..Not only was the quality of the festival much more lack-luster than it usually was, but there was also heavy traffic during and immediately after the festival as the North and Southbound travelers had to go through the much tighter roads of the city..The provincial contingents, however, did perform in the Sinulog Festival in Carmen that year, which was also the 50th anniversary of the festival in their town..The festival, for the first time, had two major parades in 2024..The ""Sinulog sa Lalawigan"", which was originally the preliminary competition ""Sinulog sa Kabataan sa Lalawigan"", was transformed into a Sinulog parade for provincial contingents since they could not, once again, dance in SRP..The Sinulog sa Lalawigan was held in the CCSC, the old venue of Sinulog..The other contingents from Cebu City and out-of-town danced in the Sinulog parade on the 3rd Sunday of January in SRP.

Literally translates to the ""Victory in Mactan"", this is a historical festival reenactment of the Battle of Mactan..Celebrated canonically on April 27, it depicts the events before, during, and immediately after the defeat of Portuguese Navigator Ferdinand Magellan at the hands of Lapu-lapu and his men..Much of the historical activities take place in Mactan Shrine, the site of the Battle of Mactan..Usually, in the Kadaugan sa Mactan, Filipino celebrities, especially celebrities of Cebuano origin, are chosen to portray the key characters of the events of the Battle of Mactan (specifically Lapu-lapu, his wife Reyna Bulakna, and Magellan)..This is typically a week-long celebration and culminates with the Rampada Festival, a stylized contemporary reenactment of the victory celebration after the battle in Mactan, incorporating Latin and ballroom dances and steps..Despite the Sinulog Festival being more popular by comparison, the Kadaugan had already been established as a festival of Cebu and its culture and history long before Sinulog was an established festival.
Pasigarbo sa Sugbo
Literally translates to the ""Celebration in Cebu"", this Festival is a relatively new festival in Cebu, conceptualized in 2008..This festival was the ""Brainchild"" of Cebu's first female governor, Gwendolyn Garcia..This festival was a program and a major tourism endeavor initiated by the governor in order to promote Cebu as an entire province and to celebrate Cebu in its culture, faith, history, and continuous advancement..In this festival, each individual town in Cebu is encouraged to showcase a theme, a product, a festival, or something unique from their place..Despite, in itself, not being a religious festival, praise, thanksgiving, and worship to God, as well as devotion to the patron saints of each town of Cebu is also given emphasis in the festival (as hinted in the category for portable processional platforms for patron saints or Best in Andas category)..Unlike the Sinulog Festival, which is limited to two major categories (Sinulog-based and Free Interpretation), Participants of Pasigarbo are given more freedom in the interpretation of the culture, faith, history, and products of their hometowns..Ever since its conception, the festival had been celebrated yearly at the Cebu International Convention Center (CICC) in Mandaue, around the date of the Provincial Charter Day of Cebu, which is celebrated every August 6, however, was ceased after 2012..This was largely due to the 2013 Bohol earthquake, which also heavily affected Cebu, as well as the lack of support from the provincial government for both the repair of the CICC and the festival itself..This was mainly because Garcia was no longer in position as governor at the time..Fortunately, the festival was recently relaunched in 2019, less than a month after Garcia's return to the provincial seat..Unlike previous celebrations, the 2019 Pasigarbo, due to the abandoned state of the CICC, was celebrated, much like the Sinulog Festival, in the Cebu City Sports Complex..As per its return, it has established itself once more as a provincial festival and a new addition to Cebu's prime festivals and significant dates, together with the Sinulog Festival and the Kadaugan sa Mactan..The festival was also halted in 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic but returned the following year in 2022..In 2022, the festival was the grandest it had ever been and was even participated by the festivals of all three independent city states (Sinulog Festival of Cebu City, Panagtagbo Festival of Mandaue City, and the Garbo Festival of Lapu-lapu City), with cities Cebu and Lapu-lapu being guest performers..The festival was again moved to the Carcar City Sports Complex that year..This was due to the ongoing renovation of the Cebu City Sports Complex, its usual venue..The move to Carcar City, was initially a very openly accepted one, however, the festival was marred by various technical difficulties on the day of the Pasigarbo sa Sugbo..Among the major problems during the festival proper was the sound glitches in certain festival jingles and in the Mayor's introductory videos, which was a new feature in this particular festival celebration..The sound glitches consisted mostly of sudden stops of the music of each festival performance, either as just a random audio cut or a complete loss of music..Governor Garcia publicly accused the sounds and lights provider for allegedly ""sabotaging"" the festival in most of the occurrences of a sound glitch..This accusation of a sabotage from the sounds and lights company head was largely due to the alleged nondisclosure that his daughter was a contestant for festival queen, who was also originally hailed as the Pasigarbo sa Sugbo Festival queen that year, with her contingent being the original champion..Though his daughter was chosen to be festival queen by the Carcar City Government for being the reigning Kabkaban Festival Queen at that time, the governor still insisted that this was a sabotage on his part under the reason that he had not fully disclosed his daughter's participation in the festival..This resulted in the postponement of the awarding ceremonies for that year's festival and a re-tabulation of the scoresheets of each festival..This further resulted in the candidate from Carcar losing her crown and the Kabkaban Festival contingent from Carcar losing their championship and being demoted to 6th place..The new festival queen was the candidate from Cordova and the new champion was the Sugat Kabanhawan Festival contingent from Minglanilla..The awarding ceremonies were held two months after the actual festival in the Cebu Technological University-Dumanjug Campus..The festival will be moved back to CCSC this year.

According to Maguindanao royal records, Islam was introduced to the Maguindanaos in the late 15th century by Sharif Muhammad Kabungsuan, a Johorean Malay Muslim noble and missionary of Arab descent..Sharif Kabungsuan invaded Malabang in 1475, facing armed resistance from the principality, nevertheless successfully vanquishing and subjugating it to his Islamic rule through the employment of Samal forces.
Cotabato became the capital of the Maguindanao Sultanate..The city became the seat of power of Sultan Muhammad Kudarat in 1619.
Spanish invasion
Christianity was introduced in 1596, but the Spaniards were unable to penetrate into the region until the second half of the 19th century..The district of Cotabato was formed in 1860, covering the areas of what is now Cotabato, Maguindanao and Sultan Kudarat provinces with its capital at Tamontaka..Fort Pikit was established by the Spaniards in 1893 as they continued their conquest of the remnants of Maguindanao Sultanate, which would soon be the site of one of the province's oldest towns, Pikit.
Further information: Spanish–Moro conflict
American rule
The coming of the Americans ushered in the creation of the Moro Province on July 15, 1903, through Act No..787 of the Philippine Commission..Cotabato, covering what are now the provinces of Cotabato, Maguindanao, Sultan Kudarat, South Cotabato and Sarangani, became a district of the huge Moro province..During the American period, large companies were established in Cotabato to exploit the vast timber resources of the region..By the 1930s, settlers from Luzon and Visayas established homesteads in Cotabato.

Postwar Era
The pace of settlement in the region accelerated in the 1950s and 1960s..The former province of Cotabato was once the largest in the Philippines..In 1966, South Cotabato was created as a separate province.
Mindanao, including Cotabato, was relatively peaceful in the 1950s and the mid-1960s..While there were some ethnic tensions, there was essentially no presence of secessionist groups in Mindanao yet.
During the Marcos dictatorship
Main articles: Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos, Moro conflict, Manili massacre, and Human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship
The relative peace of the postwar era began to change in the last years of President Ferdinand Marcos' first term, when news about the Jabidah massacre ignited a furor in the Moro community, and ethnic tensions encouraged with the formation of secessionist movements.
One major event of Martial law which took place in Cotabato was the Manili massacre, which saw the mass murder of 70
On November 22, 1973, through Presidential Decree No..341, what remained of the old Cotabato was further divided into the provinces of North Cotabato, Maguindanao, and Sultan Kudarat.
Fifth Philippine Republic era
By the aftermath of the plebiscite to form the autonomous administrative region of Bangsamoro in February 2019, 63 barangays from Cotabato's western municipalities, all of which inhabited mostly by Muslim natives, opted to join the newly formed region.
Cotabato now comprises the capital city of Kidapawan and 25 municipalities.

^ a b c d e f g h The municipalities of Kadayangan, Kapalawan, Ligawasan, Malidegao, Nabalawag, Old Kaabakan, Pahamuddin and Tugunan are under the administration of Bangsamoro as part of its special geographic area despite being geographically grouped under the province of Cotabato.
Reduction due to the establishment of the Bangsamoro
During the 2001 Referendum for inclusion to the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, 2 out of 28 barangays of Carmen, Cotabato chose to be part of ARMM, but were excluded because they are not connected to the main region of ARMM..During 2010-2016 Administration, the Bangsamoro ideal sprouted and a newly proposed region was in the making..According to the agreements signed by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Administration of Noynoy Aquino, Carmen will be included in Bangsamoro because of the two out of twenty-eight barangays that voted in favor of joining the Muslim region back in 2001..Unfortunately, Bangsamoro was not implemented before the term of Aquino ended..Despite this, the current administration aims to establish a Federal Government, where Bangamoro will be realized into a State of the Philippines wherein Carmen will be included in Bangsamoro.
Plans to establish a new municipality in the south of Carmen so that the indigenous and Christian central and northern part of Carmen will be retained in North Cotabato has yet to be confirmed..The idea arose because once the entire municipality of Carmen is included in Bangsamoro, the province of North Cotabato will be cut into half, leaving three towns (Banisilan, Alamada, and Libungan) at its west without connection to the center of North Cotabato, isolating these towns in the process.
The issue was partially resolved when the second part of the plebiscite was conducted on February 6, 2019, when 63 barangay from the towns of Pigkawayan, Libungan, Midsayap, Aleosan, Carmen, Banisilan and Pikit opted to join the new administrative autonomous region of Bangsamoro after the results of the region's formation plebiscite were confirmed three days later on February 9.

Cotabato is considered a major food basket in Mindanao..It is a top producer of cereals, tropical fruits, vegetables, sugarcane, coconut, coffee, freshwater fish and livestock.

Davao de Oro, officially the Province of Davao de Oro (Cebuano: Lalawigan sa Davao de Oro; Filipino: Lalawigan ng Davao de Oro), is a province in the Philippines located in the Davao Region in Mindanao..Its capital is Nabunturan..It used to be part of the province of Davao del Norte until it was made a separate province in 1998.
The province borders Davao del Norte to the west, Agusan del Sur to the north, and Davao Oriental to the east..To the southwest lies the Davao Gulf..The first elected governor was Jose Caballero, formerly a lawyer for a mining group in the province..It was formerly known as Compostela Valley (shortened to ComVal; Cebuano: Kawalogang Kompostela) from its inception until December 2019, when a plebiscite ratified the law that proposed to rename the province to Davao de Oro.
History
This section needs additional citations for verification..Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section..Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.Find sources: ""Davao de Oro"" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (July 2022) (Learn how and when to remove this message)
Davao de Oro, the 78th province in the country, was created out of Davao del Norte Province by virtue of Republic Act No..8470, signed by President Fidel V. Ramos on January 30, 1998..The new province was officially named Compostela Valley..On March 7 of the same year, the law was ratified through a plebiscite conducted in the eleven (11) municipalities of the mother province.
The movement to create a new province by dividing Davao del Norte started in the 1980s during the time of Congressman Lorenzo S. Sarmiento Sr., himself the author of RA No..6430..However, this was not realized until his death in the late 1980s..His son, Rogelio M. Sarmiento, who became his successor in Congress, pushed for the passage of the bill creating the province.
Upon consultation with the governor of Davao del Norte, Prospero S. Amatong, the province's other two legislators, 3rd District Congressman Rodolfo P. Del Rosario and 2nd District Congressman Baltazar A. Sator, and other provincial and municipal officials, it was decided that the addition of four municipalities, namely Maco, Mabini, Pantukan, and Laak to the proposed province would be the most ideal and equitable configuration as this would make both provinces on an almost equal footing in terms of area, population, and development opportunities..It was also decided that Nabunturan would be the capital town because of its more central location.
The name originally proposed for the province was Davao del Norte, the former name, or so it was thought, of the mother province..However, the House of Representatives’ Reference and Research Bureau, which conducted the research and legal work on the creation of the province, found out that the mother province continues to be officially referred to as Davao del Norte in most official documents including the 1987 Philippine Constitution despite the passage of RA No..6430 on June 17, 1972, renaming it as Davao Province..Tedious technical and legal issues needed to be resolved before the name could be adopted..The proposal was thus shelved and the name finally agreed upon was Compostela Valley, referring to the great fertile plain in the heartland of the province.
The origin of the province’s inhabitants came from the ethnic tribes of the Mansaka, Mandaya, Manobo, Mangguangan, Dibabawon, Aeta, Kamayo, Davaweño and Kalagan..Similar to the history of other Mindanao provinces, most of the present populations of the province are descendants of migrants who came from Luzon and Visayas islands during the pre-war and post war eras, among the Luzon migrants were Tagalogs from Bataan (thus, the town New Bataan) & Ilocanos from North Central Luzon..The bigger wave of immigrants came during the time of President Ramon Magsaysay wherein the policy of attraction adopted by the national government was to offer parcels of land to tenant-farmers..Although a virtual melting pot, the Visayans (mostly Cebuano-speaking) are the dominant group in Davao de Oro.
Upon its establishment, Davao de Oro was ruled by a succession of three governors during the first four months of its existence..The first governor of the province was Prospero S. Amatong, the three-term governor (1986-1998) of the then undivided province of Davao del Norte, who held the position only for a day..As the law creating the new province allowed incumbent elected officials of Davao del Norte the option to serve the remainder of their term in Compostela Valley, Amatong took this option and assumed the governorship of the then-Compostela Valley on March 26, 1998..The following day, he resigned and filed his candidacy for the congressional seat of the 2nd district of the new province..The governorship was turned over to Luz M. Sarmiento, by virtue of a presidential appointment..Sarmiento, the wife of then Congressman Lorenzo S. Sarmiento Sr. served the province from March 27, 1998, to June 30, 1998..She was succeeded by Jose R. Caballero.
Jose R. Caballero, a practicing lawyer and former vice governor of then undivided Davao Del Norte (1988-1992) was the first elected governor of Compostela Valley.
Arturo T. ""Chiongkee"" Uy is the fourth governor of Compostela Valley..He first served the province as member of the 3rd Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Compostela Valley (2004-2007) before he was elected as governor in the May 2007 national and local elections..He was reelected unopposed during the May 2010 national and local elections.
In 1955, the barrio (barangay) of New Sabonga was transferred to the municipality of Compostela from the municipality  of Asuncion.
On June 23, 1957, then President Carlos P. Garcia signed Republic Act No..2038 which separated Compostela from Nabunturan..The first Mayor appointed by President Carlos P. Garcia was then Mayor Pio P. Galenzoga, one of the pioneer settlers.
In the same year the sitios of Kao, Magkagong, Margosan, Matilo, Magangit, Cabacungan, Tigbatinao and Camanlangan were constituted into a barrio known as Santo Niño.
At the time, Compostela was an incongruous mixture of wooden-roofed houses concentrated along the Agusan River which was properly known as ""dungguanan"" (embarkation)..This area later became its center of trade and commerce or Poblacion.
Change of name
Main article: 2019 Compostela Valley renaming plebiscite
A Senate bill officially renaming Compostela Valley to Davao de Oro was passed in 2019..Provincial officials led by Governor Jayvee Tyron Uy justified the renaming as part of an clear up confusion with its geographic location, with the province's name sometimes associated with Cagayan Valley and the town of Compostela in Cebu, and associate it further with fellow provinces in the Davao Region..The plebiscite was held on December 7, 2019, with the majority of participants voting in favor of the name change.

History
Maguindanao era
A Maguindanaon Datu under the name Datu Bago was rewarded the territory of the surroundings of Davao Gulf by the Sultan of Maguindanao Sultanate for joining the campaign against the Spanish in the late 1700s..From his ancestral home in Maguindanao, he moved to the area in 1800 and, having convinced Bagobos and other native groups in the area to his side, conquered the entire Davao Gulf area.
Spanish colonial era
Beginnings of both Davao Region and Davao del Sur were associated with the foundation of Davao, which was the first town to be founded in southern Mindanao in 1848, following the conquest of the area by José Uyanguren of the Basque province of Gipuzkoa, Spain (Guipúzcoa in Spanish)..In 1849, Nueva Guipúzcoa province was founded in the region conquered by Uyanguren in what is now Davao Region, with Davao, then called Nueva Vergara, as the provincial capital..Uyanguren became the provincial governor, but he failed in his efforts to develop Nueva Guipúzcoa.
Thirty-six years after the foundation of Davao, the town of Santa Cruz was founded on October 5, 1884..It is the first town to be founded south of Davao and is now the oldest in the province.
American invasion era
The Spanish administration in the Philippines ended in 1898 following the defeat of the Spaniards during the Spanish–American War..In the early 1900s, waves of immigrants from the Visayas, Luzon, and as well as from Japan began to live in the region, centered mainly in Davao..The region began to boom in economic growth as agricultural business proliferated in the region.
As part of the ""food bowl"" of what is now the province of Davao del Sur, otherwise known as the Padada Valley, the agricultural area south of the town of Santa Cruz, which is known as Digos that time, lured many migrants, majority of whom came from the Visayas and Ilocos regions to settle permanently in the area..Before World War II, an enterprising American by the name of N.E..Crumb leased 10.24 square kilometres (3.95 sq mi) and transformed the place into an abaca plantation..This became the hub of economic activity in the locality during those days.
Japanese occupation era
In 1942, during the start of the World War II in the Pacific, the first waves of invading Japanese units landed and entered the province of southern Davao.
In 1945, the liberation of southern Davao by United States and Philippine Commonwealth troops was supported by Davaoeño guerrilla fighters.
Philippine independence
In 1967, Davao Province was divided into three provinces, one of them being Davao del Sur; the town of Digos was made its capital and would become a suburban city for the next 33 years.
Contemporary
On October 28, 2013, along with the Barangay Elections, a plebiscite was held to create a new province Davao Occidental, formed out of the southern part of Davao del Sur, covering the municipalities of the 2nd district of the province, namely Don Marcelino, Jose Abad Santos, Santa Maria, Sarangani and Malita (which was designated as the provincial capital) by virtue of Republic Act 10360 enacted on July 23, 2013, and the majority of votes cast were ""Yes"", ratifying the province.
In 2015, the National Competitiveness Council, ranked the province as the most competitive province in the country.
Geography
Davao del Sur covers a total area of 2,163.98 square kilometres (835.52 sq mi) The province is bounded by Davao del Norte to the north; Davao Occidental to the south-east; North Cotabato and Sultan Kudarat to the west; South Cotabato and Sarangani to the south-west; and Davao Gulf to the east.
The province is composed of sandy beaches and outlying islands, agricultural plains and valleys, rainforests, swamps, rolling hills and mountains, including the Philippines' highest peak, Mount Apo, which is at 2,954 metres (9,692 ft) above sea level.
Administrative divisions

The population of Davao del Sur in the 2020 census was 680,481 people, with a density of 310 inhabitants per square kilometre or 800 inhabitants per square mile..When Davao City is included for geographical purposes, the province's population is 2,265,579 people, with a density of 492/km2 (1,274/sq mi).
Davao del Sur is an ethnic mix of Visayans (mostly Cebuanos), Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans with a number of indigenous ethnic groups scattered across the province..The Cebuano language, with Davaoeño as its regional variant, is the main language of the province, although Filipino and English are also widely spoken and used in government functions and publications..Since the late 20th century, a linguistic phenomenon has developed in the Metro Davao area whereby locals have either shifted to the 'national language' (Filipino) or significantly mix Filipino terms and grammar into their Cebuano speech.
Religion
Main article: Religion in the Philippines
Catholicism
Christianity in the form of Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion in the province followed by more than 80% of the people.
Others
The remaining faiths are Islam and other Christians such as Aglipayan, Baptists, Iglesia ni Cristo, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Seventh-day Adventist, other Evangelical Christians and Jehovah's Witnesses.
Indigenous groups
Moro peoples
The major Moro ethnic group is the Kagan tribe, an Islamized group related to the Tagacaolos, Mandaya, Mansaka, and Kalagan, since Davao del Sur was once part of Sultanate of Maguindanao..Some Moro tribes that can be found in Davao del Sur are Maguindanaon, Maranao, Tausug and Iranun.
Lumad peoples
Main article: Lumad peoples
A Lumad woman from Davao..Lumad peoples form the most largest indigenous ethnicity in the province.
The Bagobo people live in an area that extends from Davao del Sur and South Cotabato to the foot of Mount Apo and Davao City all the way to the land bordered by the Davao and Pulangi rivers and up to northern Cotabato and southeast Bukidnon..Numbering about 80,000, their traditional costume is woven from abaca fiber and heavily ornamented with beads, shells, metal discs, embroidery and brightly colored geometric applique..Though Bagobos have the most stunning costumes among the Davao ethnic groups, they wear them only on special occasions..Like the Mandayas and Mansakas, they shave their eyebrows to a thin line and file and blacken their teeth..Bagobo smiths cast little bells which are attached to pouches, bracelets, jackets, anklets and inlaid metal boxes.
The Tagacaolo people number about 23,000 and occupy the area between the western shores of the gulf and the slopes of Mount Apo..This is one of the tribes which resisted Muslim conversion and maintained a highland animistic culture.
The Kalagan people are part Islamized and part Chistianized and related to the Tagacaolos..Numbering only about 7,000, they live along the shores of Davao Gulf.
The Mangguangan people now number only 3,000..They can be found in Davao del Sur and Davao del Norte.
In both groups, women generally wear handwoven abaca tube skirts, embroidered blue cotton tops and heavy jewellery..Men sport wide blue or white fringed and embroidered trousers and a loose shirt..Red is a color only for a headman (""bagani"") and for women of high status.
Aeta people
Main article: Aeta people
Aeta people live in some areas of Davao City all the way to Davao del Norte, Compostela Valley and Bukidnon..They are related to the Manobos of Cotabato and include sub-groups such as the Talaingod of the Kapalong forests in Davao del Norte and the Matigsalug..Numbering about 222,000, Ata men wear long-sleeved shirts, carry spears, hunt, log and grow crops..Their womenfolk wear native blouses, ""malong"" skirts and accessories of brass bracelets and bead necklaces..Mandaya and Mansaka are culturally related groups who are highly musical - playing the five string bamboo guitar, two-string lute, violin, flute, gong, drum and bamboo Jew's harp..They are also excellent silversmiths crafting breastplates, jewellery, daggers and knives..The Mandayas are famous for their colorful abaca fiber weaves embroidered with tribal motifs.

Art and culture
The colorful artistic heritage of Davao stems from the rich culture of its tribes..For the Bagobos, aesthetics is the meticulous carving of weapons; the elaborate decoration of inlaid metal boxes with bells; and the ornamentation of their abaca fiber dress with embroidery, shells, beads and metal discs..The Mandayas, on the other hand, have a solid tradition in weaving..To produce their famed coarse textured cloth, abaca fiber is colored with earth dyes and woven on a backstrap loom.
The final product is embroidered with bright-colored threads in geometric patterns..Some elements of tribal folklore are also included in the designs..The Mansakas, together with the Mandayas, are also expert silversmiths..They craft weapons, breastplates and dress accessories..Much of its people are Christians..Davao is also a harmonious blend of Christian and Muslim cultures..However, its most stunning cultural aspect is definitely its ethnic art which encompasses music, dance, religious ritual, dress and ornamentation.

Davao Occidental (Cebuano: Kasadpang Dabaw; Filipino: Kanluraning Davao), officially the Province of Davao Occidental (Cebuano: Lalawigan sa Kasadpang Dabaw, Lalawigan sa Davao Occidental; Filipino: Lalawigan ng Kanluraning Davao, Lalawigan ng Davao Occidental), is a province in the Philippines located in the Davao Region in Mindanao..Its capital is the municipality of Malita..To the east lies Davao Gulf..It also shares a maritime border with the Indonesian province of North Sulawesi to the south.
History
Sultanate era
Davao Occidental was part of a Sultanate of Maguindanao but for the Sarangani, it was later became part of Buayan Sultanate.
American colonization era
What is now Davao Occidental was once a part of the now-defunct Davao Province which encompasses the entirety of present-day Davao Region..Section 1 of Philippine Commission Act No..164 dated December 10, 1904 indicated that much of its area as far as what is now Malita once belonged to the municipality of Santa Cruz..The original chief inhabitants of the area were the indigenous Lumad tribes including the Matigsalugs and Tagakaulos..Around the early 1900s onward, migrants from Luzon and the Visayas settled in the area, many of whom intermarried with the indigenous people; as decades progressed, the descendants of the migrants became the majority of the population.
The municipality of Malita was founded on November 13, 1936 per Proclamation No..64 signed by President Manuel Quezon..It was the first town to be established in the area of what is now Davao Occidental and would later serve as its provincial capital..More towns in the area are established later: Trinidad (now Jose Abad Santos) in 1948, Sta Maria in 1968, Don Marcelino in 1979, and Sarangani in 1980.
Philippine independence
On May 8, 1967, Davao Province was split into three provinces, one of them being Davao del Sur which included the municipalities of what would later comprise Davao Occidental.
Foundation
Main article: 2013 Davao Occidental creation plebiscite
Davao Occidental was created through Republic Act 10360 enacted on July 23, 2013, comprising five of the eight municipalities that constitute the 2nd district of Davao del Sur..RA 10360 was passed by the House of Representatives and Senate on November 28, 2012, and December 5, 2012, respectively, and signed by President Benigno Aquino III on January 14, 2013.
The motive of creating the province was to boost the economic condition and social progress of the municipalities..Then Senator Bongbong Marcos, who sponsored the creation of Davao Occidental, said that the distances of Digos, Davao del Sur's provincial capital, to other municipalities in the second Congressional District are far-off that impairs the effective delivery of basic services, as well as the access to government offices.
Government officials of Davao del Sur with assistance from the Department of the Interior and Local Government exercised jurisdiction over the Davao Occidental until the elected local officials of the 2016 elections assumed office.
Geography
Davao Occidental covers a total area of 2,163.45 square kilometres (835.31 sq mi) occupying the southwestern tip of the Davao Region in Mindanao..The province is bordered on the northwest by Davao del Sur; west by Sarangani and northeast by Davao Gulf.
The topography of Davao Occidental is hilly, rugged and sloping, with nearly the whole province consisting of mountains..Its eastern shoreline consists of cliffs and beaches with hills immediately on their backs..Coconut trees and hardwood trees mostly dominate the provincial mainland.
Government
The province of Davao Occidental is governed by a governor and a vice governor..The whole province is a lone congressional legislative district..The municipality of Malita, the largest and most populous in the province, serves as the provincial capital and the place where the provincial officials of Davao Occidental convene.
Administrative divisions
The province comprises 5 municipalities.

The population of Davao Occidental in the 2020 census was 317,159 people, with a density of 150 inhabitants per square kilometre or 390 inhabitants per square mile.
The population mostly consists of people whose ancestors originate from the migrants from Visayan Islands and Luzon..The Lumad natives only form a small part of the population and live in the more mountainous and forested areas of the province..Indonesian settlers of Sangirese descent even live in the province.
Economy
The shores of Malita as seen from the hilltops.
The main industries in Davao Occidental are aquaculture and agriculture..Economic produce in the province include fish, bananas and coconuts which are then exported to several major cities within southern Mindanao, including Davao City..Rice farms are only limited to the few flat lands in the province due to its mountainous and thickly forested nature.
The capital town of Malita is the province's main commercial hub.
Tourism has started to gain traction in the province, with potential tourist destinations mostly concentrated in the province's coastal beaches and the Sarangani and Balut islands in the south.
Transportation
Davao Occidental is served by only one partially-coastal highway that traverses the whole length of the provincial mainland from north to south, and could only be accessed by going through the road crossings in Sulop in Davao del Sur province and, farther ahead, in the city of General Santos..Buses, jeepneys and passenger vans that originate from and serve the cities of Davao and Digos are the main primary modes of transportation in the province..Boats serve as the primary maritime mode of transportation for coastal areas not yet accessible by roads and the island municipality of Sarangani.

History
Early history
Further information: Sultanate of Maguindanao
The present territory of Davao Oriental was covered by the historical region of Caraga, which was under the Sultanate of Maguindanao.
Spanish colonial era
The Spaniards established a permanent settlement in the region in 1591, and in 1844, the area was ceded by the Sultanate to Spain..An expedition was sent by the colonial government in Manila in 1847 to control the region, led by the Spaniard Jose Oyanguren, who settled in the town of Davao and organized the surrounding areas into the province of Nueva Guipozcoa in 1849..The province existed until 1858, when the politico-military commandancias of Davao and Bislig were created in its place..Bislig was incorporated into the District of Davao two years later.
American colonial era
Further information: Moro Province, Department of Mindanao and Sulu, and Davao (province)
Davao province in 1918 encompassing the current provinces of Davao Region
In 1903, the colonial American government created the Moro Province comprising several districts, one of which was Davao..The Moro province was converted in 1914 into the Department of Mindanao and Sulu, and its component districts were made into independent provinces.
Japanese occupation
In 1942, the territory of what is now Davao Oriental was occupied by the Japanese Imperial forces.
In 1945, the Battle of Davao began with the combined forces of the British, Australian, Dutch and the Filipino troops of the 6th, 101st, 102nd, 103rd, 104th, 106th, 107th and 110th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 10th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary being supported by Davaoeño guerrilla fighter units in attacking Japanese Imperial forces during the liberation in Eastern Davao or Eastern Davao Campaign until the end of the Second World War.
Philippine independence
Foundation

This section needs expansion..You can help by adding to it..(December 2015)
Contemporary
The capital town of Mati became a component city by virtue of Republic Act No..9408 which sought to convert the municipality into a city..The law was ratified on June 16, 2007..However, the cityhood status was lost twice in the years 2008 and 2010 after the LCP questioned the validity of the cityhood law..The cityhood status was reaffirmed after the court finalized its ruling on February 15, 2011 which declared the cityhood law constitutional.

Dinagat Islands (Cebuano: Mga Pulo sa Dinagat; Surigaonon: Mga Puyo nan Dinagat; Kabalian: Mga Puyo san Dinagat; Waray: Mga Purô han Dinagat; Filipino: Mga Islang Dinagat), officially the Province of Dinagat Islands, is an island province in the Caraga region of the Philippines, located on the south side of Leyte Gulf..The island of Leyte is to its west, across Surigao Strait, and mainland Mindanao is to its south..Its main island, Dinagat, is about 60 kilometres (37 mi) from north to south..San Jose serves as its provincial capital.
Etymology
The name of the island means ""of the sea"" or ""like the sea"", an affixed from of the root word dagat (""sea"") in the Visayan languages.
History
Surigao province map in 1918
Early history
The province in pre-colonial times was much influenced by the Rajahnate of Butuan which was nestled in present-day Agusan del Norte..It was also used as the entry point of the Rajahnate of Ternate, present-day Moluccas of Indonesia, to attack the Rajahnate of Butuan, Rajahnate of Cebu, the indigenous settlements in the Anda Peninsula of Bohol, and the Kingdom of Dapitan (located 'between' Panglao and Bohol), which later moved in northern Zamboanga after the Kingdom of Dapitan was destroyed.
Spanish colonial era
Although one of the newest provinces of the country, settlements in the Dinagat Islands were already present during the Spanish regime as a result of migration of people from nearby provinces of Bohol and Leyte..In particular during World War II, the allegedly magical province had a significant impact on the history of the nation.
The municipality was formally established in 1855..It occupies the territorial boundaries of the whole island..From 1890 to 1990 its boundaries were gradually reduced giving rise to six municipalities, Loreto, Cagdianao, Libjo, Basilisa, Tubajon and San Jose.
Soldiers of the 6th Ranger Battalion move through a village on Dinagat Island, 18 October 1944.
Loreto became a Spanish pueblo on September 4, 1890, under the supervision of Governor General Manuel Sanchez by the virtue of Direccion General No..30..It was originally called Mabua due to the ever-foaming river that runs right into the center of the community..It was named Loreto in 1881 by the Spanish priest who frequents the town, in honor of the wife of the Alcalde Mayor of the Province of Surigao.
Japanese occupation era
The province was the site of the historic Battle of Surigao Strait during the Second World War..The Municipality of Loreto became the entry point of the American Liberation Forces on October 17, 1944..It was on this shore that the 6th Ranger Battalion of the 6th U.S. Army under Col. Mucci landed at Sitio Campintac of Barangay Panamaon in Loreto..It was during this landing that the first American flag flew on Philippine soil since the Japanese invasion in 1941..The Americans named the place ""Black Beach No..2.""
The northern part of the island served as a refuge for the American soldiers, while the western border was held by Japanese forces..Capsized vessel structures are still found today in the waters of Basilisa.
Philippine independence
On December 23, 1959, Cagdianao was created into a municipality under Executive Order No..367..Its name came from the Spanish word Cada dia linao meaning ""everyday peaceful and calm""..However, some scholars say that its name came from the Visayan word Taga Danaw meaning ""the lake people"".
Libjo was created into a municipality and named Albor on February 29, 1960, under Executive Order No..381..It was taken from the municipalities of Dinagat and Loreto..Albor came from the surname of the mayors of Loreto and Dinagat — Alfaro and Borja..It was renamed as Libjo on June 17, 1967..The name came from the word Liboo, a kind of mussel clam.
Philippine Benevolent Missionaries Association Shrine built and maintained by members of the association in memory of Ruben Edera Ecleo Sr. the founder of the PBMA, Situated at Aurelio, San Jose.
In 1965, Ruben Edera Ecleo Sr. founded the Philippine Benevolent Missionaries Association (PBMA) at Sitio Puyange, now Poblacion in San Jose..PBMA is a non-sectarian organization bounded by a strong spirit of brotherhood..Not long after that, members from all over the Philippines migrated to the island to be in constant association with their founder.
Meanwhile, Basilisa became a municipality on June 17, 1967, under Republic Act No..4986..It was then named as Rizal, after the country's national hero.
Tubajon, which was once a barangay of Loreto, became a municipality on June 21, 1969, under Republic Act No..5643.
The newest municipality is San Jose, created on November 15, 1989, under Republic Act No..6769..The town was named in honor of Jose Ecleo who was its pioneer and father of then mayor of the municipality of Dinagat, Ruben Edera Ecleo Sr..The town is the seat of the PBMA.
Contemporary
The Dinagat Islands was part of the First District of Surigao del Norte Province until it became a province on December 2, 2006, with the approval of Republic Act No..9355 (authored by Rep. Glenda B. Ecleo), the Charter of the Province of the Dinagat Islands, in a plebiscite.
On February 11, 2010, the Supreme Court of the Philippines declared the creation of the Dinagat Islands Province null and void on grounds of failure to meet land area and population requirements for the creation of local government units.
On April 12, 2011, the Supreme Court reversed its earlier ruling,

Eastern Samar (Waray-Waray: Sinirangan Samar; Tagalog: Silangang Samar), officially the Province of Eastern Samar, is a province in the Philippines located in the Eastern Visayas region..Its capital is the city of Borongan..Eastern Samar occupies the eastern portion of the island of Samar..Bordering the province to the north is the province of Northern Samar and to the west is Samar province..To the east lies the Philippine Sea, part of the vast Pacific Ocean, while to the south lies Leyte Gulf.
History
Spanish colonial era
During his circumnavigation of the globe, Ferdinand Magellan had set foot on the tiny island of Homonhon in the southern part of the province..On March 16, 1521, the area of what is now Eastern Samar is said to be the first Philippine landmass spotted by Magellan and his crew.
American invasion era
Philippine-American War
Further information: Philippine–American War
Maj. Eugenio Daza Area Commander of General Lukbán's forces for Southeastern Samar
Balangiga Encounter
Further information: Balangiga massacre
On September 28, 1901,  Filipino guerrillas led by Valeriano Abanador and Eugenio Daza in Balangiga ambushed American troops, killing 48 members of the US 9th Infantry..The incident triggered the infamous American retaliation March across Samar against the Samar populace and guerrillas.
Japanese occupation era
In 1944, combined Filipino-American troops involved in the liberation of the Philippines from Japan built in the town of Guiuan the largest military base in the Pacific..In the same town in 1949, approximately 5,000 Russian refugees escaping from communist China temporarily settled on Tubabao Island until 1951, when they were transferred to Australia and the United States.
Philippine independence
Foundation
Eastern Samar, as a province, was created from Samar province through Republic Act No..4221 on June 19, 1965..Approved by Congress in 1963, it was authored by Samar congressmen Eladio T. Balite (1st district), Fernando R. Veloso (2nd district), and Felipe J. Abrigo (3rd district)..The law, ratified in a plebiscite on June 19, 1965, divided Samar into three: Northern Samar, Eastern Samar and (Western) Samar.
Contemporary
The capital town of Borongan became a component city by virtue of Republic Act No..9394 which sought to convert the municipality into a city..The law was ratified on June 21, 2007..However, the cityhood status was lost twice in the years 2008 and 2010 after the LCP questioned the validity of the cityhood law..The cityhood status was reaffirmed after the court finalized its ruling on February 15, 2011 which declared the cityhood law constitutional.
Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda), one of the strongest typhoons ever recorded, made its first landfall in the coastal town of Guiuan in November 2013.
Geography
Eastern Samar covers a total area of 4,660.47 square kilometers (1,799.42 sq mi) occupying the eastern section and majority of southern Samar's coast of Samar Island in the Eastern Visayas region..The province is bordered to the north by Northern Samar and to the west by Samar..To the east lies the Philippine Sea, part of the vast Pacific Ocean, while to the south lies Leyte Gulf.
Because it faces the Philippine Sea of the Pacific Ocean, Eastern Samar suffers heavily from powerful typhoons.
Administrative divisions
Eastern Samar comprises 22 municipalities and one city, all encompassed by an lone congressional district and two provincial districts that elect a representative and provincial board members, respectively.

Guimaras (), officially the Province of Guimaras (Hiligaynon: Kapuoran sang Guimaras; Tagalog: Lalawigan ng Guimaras), is an island province in the Philippines located in the Western Visayas region..The capital is Jordan, while the largest local government unit is the municipality of Buenavista..The province is situated in Panay Gulf, between the islands of Panay and Negros..To the northwest is the city and province of Iloilo and to the southeast is Negros Occidental..The whole island is part of the Metro Iloilo–Guimaras, one of the twelve metropolitan areas of the Philippines.
The province consists primarily of Guimaras Island, and also includes Inampulugan, Guiwanon (or Guiuanon), Panobolon, Natunga, Nadulao, and many surrounding islets.
Guimaras, formerly known as Himal-os, was a sub-province of Iloilo until it was made an independent province on May 22, 1992.
History
Spanish colonial era
About 1581, Gonzalo Ronquillo de Peñalosa, Spanish governor and Captain-General of the Philippine Islands, established a settlement in Guimaras for the purpose of Christianizing the island's natives..He and his subordinates organized the pueblicitos or villages of Nayup under the patronage of Saint Peter the Apostle, and Igang with Saint Anne as patroness.
Evangelization of Guimaras occurred around the same time the friars were making inroads in Panay..The Augustinians established the visitas (chapelries) of Nayup and Igang as subordinate to Oton, Iloilo..Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas, the 7th Spanish Governor-General, noted in a June 20, 1591, report to King Philip II that the friars of Oton made regular visits to the island.
In 1742, the island came under the jurisdiction of Dumangas – now known as Iloilo, until 1751 when the Augustinian Order was replaced by the Jesuits, after which the Dominican order took over Guimaras..The Jesuits, who had established a school in Iloilo and had missions in Molo and Arevalo, took charge of the island..By 1755, it was organized into a regular parish..When the population increased considerably, the island was given its municipal status with a seat of government at Tilad (today Buenavista).
American invasion era
Under American rule, the Guimarasnons were given the opportunity to elect their municipal president in 1908.
Douglas MacArthur, a fresh graduate from West Point as a Second Lieutenant at the age of 23, came to Iloilo as the head of the company of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers..They constructed roads and the Santo Rosario Wharf, presently named MacArthur's Wharf, which are still in use today..In November 1903, while working on Guimaras, he was ambushed by a pair of Filipino brigands or guerrillas; he shot and killed both with his pistol.
Japanese occupation era
In 1942, Japanese Imperial forces landed on Guimaras Island as the Empire of Japan began its occupation of the country during the Second World War..The Japanese controlled almost every island between the Philippines and Hawaii..The U.S..Forces needed these islands to run aircraft to and from the Philippines, while denying Japan usage..The U.S. Army and Navy planned indirect attacks that would eventually lead them to Luzon.
In 1945, 10 U.S. divisions and 5 independent regiments would battle for Luzon, making it the largest campaign of the war and involving more troops than the United States had used in North Africa, Italy or southern France..The combined United States and Philippine Commonwealth forces landed on Guimaras Island, attacking the Japanese and defeating them in the Battle of Guimaras, which led to the liberation of the island.
Philippine independence
Provincial status
Guimaras gained its status as a sub-province of Iloilo through Republic Act 4667,
Shortly after Guimaras acquired its provincial status, President Fidel V. Ramos appointed Emily Relucio-López as its first Governor.
The province of Guimaras was originally composed of three municipalities: Buenavista, Jordan, and Nueva Valencia..In 1995, through Republic Act No..7896 and Republic Act No..7897, the municipalities of Sibunag and San Lorenzo were created..The two new municipalities officially acquired their municipal status after the May 8, 1995, plebiscite held simultaneously with the local election.
Ernesto L. Gedalanga was the first appointed mayor of Sibunag and Arsenio Zambarrano was also appointed mayor of San Lorenzo..The temporary seat of government of the Municipality of Sibunag is at Barangay Dasal while the temporary seat of Government of the Municipality of San Lorenzo is at Barangay Cabano.
Contemporary

Ifugao, officially the Province of Ifugao (Ilocano: Probinsia ti Ifugao; Tagalog: Lalawigan ng Ifugao), is a landlocked province of the Philippines in the Cordillera Administrative Region in Luzon..Its capital is Lagawe and it borders Benguet to the west, Mountain Province to the north, Isabela to the east, and Nueva Vizcaya to the south.
The Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras and Banaue Rice Terraces are the main tourist attractions in the province..These terraces are believed to have been hand-carved into the mountains 2,000 years ago to plant rice..However, recent research by carbon dating suggests that they were built much later.
Etymology
Ifugao is named after the term i-pugo (""i""
History
Spanish colonial era
The Spanish had great difficulty in taking over Ifugao, like most of the Cordilleras due to the fierce belief of the Cordillera people of their rights since ancient times..The Ifugao battled colonizers for hundreds of years, even after the state was colonized and was transformed into a part of Nueva Vizcaya province of the Spanish-administered Philippines..The Spanish occupation in the province ended with the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution.
In the Northern Philippines, the Ifugao people are one of many minority ethnolinguistic groups best documented by ethnohistoric and anthropological scholars..However, there is a dearth of historical information in the region particularly during the Spanish conquest..Changes in both demographics and cultural orientation among existing communities were to be expected during the time as certain groups resulted to migration towards the highlands..According to studies, the Ifugao succeeded multiple times resisting against the Spanish at conquest..The groups that migrated to the highlands were believed to be those that resisted the Spanish colonial control, which became prevalent in the lowlands..According to Acabado, the rugged nature of the highlands around the Ifugao region did not out rightly provide a hindrance to the Spanish conquest..Other regions that had similar rugged environment as found in Ifugao were subjected to colonial rule..Archeological research shows Ifugao practices of successful resistance by strengthening their political and economic resources..Spanish conquest and population increase was the source of shifting to wet-rice agriculture.
American invasion era

On August 18, 1908, Ifugao was separated from Nueva Vizcaya
Japanese occupation era
Ifugao became the center of warfare in the last year of World War II when Gen. Tomoyuki Yamashita launched his last stand against the American and Philippine Commonwealth forces at Mount Napulawan..He informally surrendered to Captain Grisham of the 6th US Army in the Philippines based in Kiangan,
Philippine independence
On June 18, 1966, Republic Act No..4695 was enacted, and Ifugao was converted into a regular province when the huge Mountain Province was split into four (the other three being Benguet, Mountain Province, and Kalinga-Apayao)..The capital was moved from Kiangan to Lagawe due to the harsh landscape of Kiangan which made it unsuitable for public transportation and as a capital.
Post-martial law era
On July 15, 1987, the Cordillera Administrative Region was established by then-President Corazon Aquino through Executive Order 220, and Ifugao was made one of its provinces.
Contemporary

In 1992, Republic Act No..07173 was enacted, separating several barangays from Kiangan and constituting them under a new municipality known as Asipulo.
Since 1992, the province has observed every September 2 as ""Victory Day"", commemorating the valor of Philippine war veterans and the surrender of General Yamashita in the municipality of Kiangan on September 2, 1945.
In 1995, the Batad Rice Terraces, Bangaan Rice Terraces (both in Banaue), Mayoyao Rice Terraces (in Mayoyao), Hungduan Rice Terraces (in Hungduan) and Nagacadan Rice Terraces (in Kiangan, Ifugao) were inscribed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site under the collective name ""Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras"".
In 2001, the Hudhud Chants of the Ifugao was chosen as one of the 11 Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity..It was then formally inscribed as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2008.
In 2013, the official Intangible Heritage Book of the Philippine was published, and 13 of its elements were from Ifugao.
In 2014, the Philippines joined other Asian nations in establishing the support and submission of the ""Tug of war"" — a multinational cultural heritage or Tugging rituals and games, an Intangible Cultural Heritage that encompasses tug-of-war games in Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Philippines..The initial move of the Philippines started in 2013..The Philippines' part in the new element is represented by the tug-of-war of the Ifugaos (in Barangay Hapao, Municipality of Hungduan) called the punnuk..The element is expected to be declared as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2015.
Since the 20th century, the province has been central to the archaeological research of various international institutions, mostly from the United States and the Philippines..A major discovery was the archaeological site of Kiangan, which proved the oral tradition of the Ifugao that the first settlement in the province was in Kiangan.

Wet rice cultivation and ritual feasting
Shifting to wet rice cultivation is one factor that intensified the social ranking that was already present among the Ifugao society..Those who adopted wet rice cultivation were able to consolidate political resources..“In Ifugao, the adoption of wet-rice agriculture is at the forefront in discussions regarding social ranking vis-à-vis prestige economy.”
Furthermore, archeologists state that there was an increase of pig consumption..This increase had to do with the increase in ritual feasting..In the Old Kiyyangan Village, there were morphometric evidence of the vast increase in pig consumption..Stephen Acabado states that since the village was increasing in population the shift to wet rice cultivation, increase of exotic goods procurement, and finally increase in the distribution of ritual animals indicates “political elaboration as a response to Spanish conquest”..In the article Resistance through rituals: The role of Philippine “native pig” (Sus scrofa) in Ifugao feasting and socio-political organization, the authors conclude that domesticated pigs were intertwined in the maintenance of a rank social order that came into view from the Ifugao's resistance against Spanish colonialism.
The domestication of pigs and terrace cultivation within the Ifugao region provides a perfect scenario of how societies respond to challenges and needs in their immediate environment..Since wild pigs were considered unfit for rituals, emphasis was placed towards the domestication pigs, which illustrated an individual's social status..The bigger the feast, the higher regard a person was likely to receive from both kin and non-kin members as the ceremony would involve the sharing of sacrificed pig meat.

Rice culture

The Spanish first described the Ifugao rice terraces in 1801..Though as William Scott notes, ""These impressive stone-walled fields, irrigated for both rice and taro, had been known from the time of the first expeditions in to Kiangan in the 1750s..."": 2
Ifugao culture revolves around rice, which is considered a prestige crop..There is an elaborate and complex array of rice culture feasts inextricably linked with taboos and intricate agricultural rites, from rice cultivation to rice consumption..Harvest season calls for grandiose thanksgiving feasts, while the concluding harvest rites tungo or tungul (the day of rest) entail a strict taboo of any agricultural work..Partaking of the rice wine (bayah), rice cakes, and moma (mixture of several herbs, powdered snail shell and betel nut/arecoline which is used as a chewing gum to the Ifugaos) is an indelible practice during the festivities and ritual activities..Agricultural terracing and farming are the principal means of livelihood..Their social status is measured by the number of rice field granaries, family heirlooms, gold earrings, and carabaos (water buffaloes)..Prestige is also conferred through time and tradition.
A prayer is said by an elderly woman when harvest begins, directed towards Cabunian, the goddess of rice..Then, a protective prayer is said before the rice is placed in the granary..: 21
The Ifugao solar calendar included a 365-day year, broken down into 13 months of 28 days each, plus one extra day..: 37
Ifugao culture values kinship, family ties, religious and cultural beliefs..Ifugao are unique among all ethnic groups in the mountain province for their narrative literature such as the hudhud, an epic dealing with hero ancestors sung in a poetic manner..Also unique to the Ifugao is their woodcarving art, most notably the carved granary guardians bulul and the prestige bench of the upper class, the hagabi..Their textiles are renowned for their sheer beauty, colorful blankets and clothing woven on looms.
Traditional attire for male Ifugaos consists of a simple G-string..Ifugao women, on the contrary, wear tapis, a wraparound skirt..: 81–83, 89

UNESCO recognitions in Ifugao
UNESCO has inscribed two Ifugao elements in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2008 and 2015, respectively..UNESCO has also inscribed one Ifugao site with five properties in the World Heritage Site in 1995.
Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras
An Ifugao man harvesting rice at the Batad Rice Terraces.
In 1995, the Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras was inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List..UNESCO states:
""For 2,000 years, the high rice fields of the Ifugao have followed the contours of the mountains..The fruit of knowledge handed down from one generation to the next, and the expression of sacred traditions and a delicate social balance, they have helped to create a landscape of great beauty that expresses the harmony between humankind and the environment.""
The inscription has five sites: the Batad Rice Terraces, Bangaan Rice Terraces (both in Banaue), Mayoyao Rice Terraces (in Mayoyao), Hungduan Rice Terraces (in Hungduan) and Nagacadan Rice Terraces (in Kiangan), all in the Ifugao Province, the Philippines..The Banaue Rice Terraces are not included in the inscription, but may be included through an extension nomination to UNESCO, along with other rice terraces sites in other Philippine Cordillera provinces.
Hudhud Chants of the Ifugao
In 2001, the Hudhud ni Aliguyon (or Hudhud Chants of the Ifugao) became one of the first 11 Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity in 2001..The element was inscribed in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2008..UNESCO describes the element as follows:
The Hudhud consists of narrative chants traditionally performed by the Ifugao community, which is well known for its rice terraces extending over the highlands of the northern island of the Philippine archipelago..It is practised during the rice sowing season, at harvest time and at funeral wakes and rituals..Thought to have originated before the seventh century, the Hudhud comprises more than 200 chants, each divided into 40 episodes..A complete recitation may last several days..Since the Ifugao’s culture is matrilineal, the wife generally takes the main part in the chants, and her brother occupies a higher position than her husband..The language of the stories abounds in figurative expressions and repetitions and employs metonymy, metaphor and onomatopoeia, rendering transcription very difficult..Thus, there are very few written expressions of this tradition..The chant tells about ancestral heroes, customary law, religious beliefs and traditional practices, and reflects the importance of rice cultivation..The narrators, mainly elderly women, hold a key position in the community, both as historians and preachers..The Hudhud epic is chanted alternately by the first narrator and a choir, employing a single melody for all the verses..The conversion of the Ifugao to Catholicism has weakened their traditional culture..Furthermore, the Hudhud is linked to the manual harvesting of rice, which is now mechanized..Although the rice terraces are listed as a World Heritage Site, the number of growers has been in constant decline.The few remaining narrators, who are already very old, need to be supported in their efforts to transmit their knowledge and to raise awareness among young people.
Tugging Games and Ritual: Punnuk of the Ifugao
The Punnuk of the Ifugao was inscribed in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2015 under the multinational inscription of the Tugging Rituals and Games element.

Early history
Long before the arrival of the Spaniards, there existed an extensive region consisting of Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Abra and La Union..Merchants from Japan and China would often visit the area to trade gold for beads, ceramics and silk..The Austronesian inhabitants of the region called their place samtoy, from sao mi toy, which literally meant ""our language"".
Spanish colonial era
In 1571, the Spanish conquistadors had Manila under their control and they began looking for new sites to conquer..Miguel Lopez de Legazpi's grandson Juan de Salcedo volunteered to lead one of these expeditions..Together with 8 armed boats and 45 men the 22-year-old voyager headed north..On June 13, 1572, Salcedo and his men landed in present-day Vigan then proceeded to Laoag, Currimao and Badoc..As they sailed along the coast they were surprised to see numerous sheltered coves (looc) where the locals lived in harmony..They named the region Ylocos and its people Ylocanos.
As the Christianization of the region grew so did the landscape of the area..Vast tracts of land were utilized for churches and bell towers in line with the Spanish mission of bajo las campanas..: 47
Spanish colonization of the region was not completely successful..Owing to the abusive practices of many Augustinian friars a number of Ilocanos revolted..Noteworthy of these were the Dingras uprising (1589) and the Pedro Almasan revolt (San Nicolas, 1660)..In 1762, Diego Silang led a series of battles aimed at freeing the Ilocano..When he died from his friendly fire his widow Gabriela continued his cause..She too was captured and executed.
In 1807 the sugar cane (basi) brewers of Piddig rose up in arms to protest the government's monopoly of the wine industry..In 1898, the church excommunicated Gregorio Aglipay for refusing to cut off ties with the revolutionary forces of Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo..Unperturbed, he helped established the Iglesia Filipina Independiente.
In an effort to gain political control and because of the increasing population of the region, a Royal Decree was signed on February 2, 1818, splitting Ilocos into two provinces: Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur..Soon thereafter, La Union and Abra became independent provinces.
Japanese occupation era
After the fall of Corregidor and the subsequent occupation of the Philippines by the Empire of Japan, a number of small guerilla groups formed in the area of Ilocos Norte, some of which resorted to banditry.
Philippine independence
See also: Tobacco production in the Philippines and Stonehill scandal
The decade after the recognition of Philippine independence marked a return of the tobacco industry to Ilocos Norte..Ever since the end of the tobacco monopoly, tobacco production had declined in the Ilocos as filipinos started shifting from locally made cigars to foreign made cigarettes.
During the Marcos dictatorship
Main article: Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos
See also: Human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship and Unexplained wealth of the Marcos family
Ilocos Norte gained additional prominence in December 1965 when Ferdinand Marcos became president, and again when he won a second term in 1969, boosted by debt-driven infrastructure spending that created economic crises and massive social unrest at the beginning of the 1970s.
Various human rights violations were documented in the Ilocos Norte region during the Marcos martial law era, despite public perception that the region was supportive of Marcos' administration.
There were also various protests against the Marcos administration at the time, with Aurora Park in the Laoag Plaza being one of the favored places to stage protests.
Contemporary
The municipality of Batac became a component city by virtue of Republic Act No..9407 which sought to convert the municipality into a city..The law was ratified on June 23, 2007..However, the cityhood status was lost twice in the years 2008 and 2010 after the LCP questioned the validity of the cityhood law..The cityhood status was reaffirmed after the court finalized its ruling on February 15, 2011 which declared the cityhood law constitutional.
Ilocos Norte was among the provinces affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, reporting its first three cases of COVID-19 on March 31, 2020, including a male patient each from Batac and Paoay, and former senator Bongbong Marcos, who had arrived from travel to Spain.

Ilocos Sur, officially the Province of Ilocos Sur (Ilocano: Probinsia ti Ilocos Sur; Tagalog: Lalawigan ng Ilocos Sur), is a province in the Philippines located in the Ilocos Region in Luzon..Located on the mouth of the Mestizo River is the capital of Vigan..Ilocos Sur is bordered by Ilocos Norte and Abra to the north, Mountain Province to the east, La Union and Benguet to the south and the South China Sea to the west.
Ilocos Sur was founded by the Spanish conquistador Juan de Salcedo in 1572..It was formed when the north (now Ilocos Norte) split from the south (Ilocos Sur)..At that time, it included parts of Abra and the upper half of present-day La Unión..The current boundary of the province was permanently defined through Act No..2683 signed in March 1917.
The province is home to two UNESCO World Heritage Sites, namely, the Heritage City of Vigan and the Baroque Church of Santa Maria.
History

Early history
Before the arrival of the Spanish, the coastal plains in northwest Luzón from Bangui in the north to Namacpacan in the south were a region called the Ylokos..It lies between the South China Sea in the west and the Northern Cordilleras in the east..On the western side, the land is sandy..On the eastern side (near the mountains that separate the region from the Mountain Province) the land is rocky, leaving a narrow strip of plain for cultivation..The mountains come so close to the sea that the highway is carved into them..The pressure of increasing population and the need for land made the people thrifty, and they built their villages near small bays and coves called looc in the local dialect..These coastal inhabitants were known as Ylocos, which means ""from the lowlands""..The region was then called by the ancient name Samtoy, from sao mi ditoy (""our language"" in Ilocano).
Spanish colonial era
The Ilocos region was a thriving and fairly-advanced cluster of towns and settlements familiar to Chinese, Japanese, and Malay traders when the Spanish explorer Juan de Salcedo arrived in Vigan on June 13, 1572..The Spanish made Cabigbigaan their headquarters, which Salcedo called Villa Fernandina and which became known as the Intramuros de Ilocandia..Salcedo declared all of Northern Luzón an encomienda (land grant)..He was the encomendero of Vigan and lieutenant governor of Ylokos until his death in July 1574.
Augustinian missionaries evangelized the region, establishing parishes and building churches that still stand..Three centuries later, Vigan became the seat of the Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia.
The coast of Samtoy was known to the Spanish colonizers in 1572, when Juan de Salcedo traveled along it..Sent by Miguel López de Legazpi to explore the island of Luzón, Salcedo founded Ciudad Fernandina in 1574 in Bigan, in present-day Ilocos Sur..It became the center of Spanish rule and influence, including the evangelization and pacification movements..Due to Salcedo's efforts, the settlements in Tagurín, Santa Lucía, Nalbacán, Bantay, Candón and Sinayt were pacified and paid tribute to the King of Spain.
Conversions
According to the Spanish chronicler Pigafetta, ""The Ilocos are all Christians and are the humblest and most tractable""..The Augustinians established parishes in Santa in 1576, Tagurín in 1586, Santa Lucía in 1586, Nalbacán in 1587, Candón in 1591, and Bantay in 1590..They built a church in Bigan in 1641 which, 117 years later, become the cathedral of the episcopal see of Nueva Segovia.
Partition of Ylokos
Ylokos consisted of the present-day provinces of Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Abra and part of Mountain Province..A royal decree of February 2, 1818 separated Ilocos Norte from Ilocos Sur, the latter including northern La Union (as far as Namacpacan, present-day Luna) and present-day Abra..The sub-provinces of Lepanto and Amburayan in Mountain Province were annexed by Ilocos Sur..The passage of Act No..2683 by the Philippine Legislature in March 1917 defined the province's geographical boundaries.
Vigan
Vigan, almost four centuries old, was once known as Kabigbigaan (from biga, a coarse, erect plant with large, ornate leaves that grows on riverbanks)..Bigan was later changed to Vigan..To the Spanish it was Villa Fernandina, in honor of King Ferdinand.
Vigan was founded in 1574 by Spanish conquistador Juan de Salcedo as the capital of Ylocos..The town, with a population of 8,000 (greater than that of Manila at the time), was the center of Malayan civilization before Salcedo's arrival..It was somewhat prosperous, trading with the Chinese and Japanese who brought jars, silk and crockery through the nearby port of Pandan, Caoayan.
In the 19th century, Vigan traded with Europe; ships loaded with indigo went to textile mills..The invention of chemical dyes in Germany eliminated this industry..Affluent citizens of Vigan stocked their homes with statuettes of brass and iron, dinnerware, and other artifacts of European civilization, including fine ivory, inlaid furniture, and Chinese wares.
Social institutions
Salcedo bequeathed his encomienda to a select group who continued the tenancy system which developed into the practice of caciquism, landlordism and usury..The kaillanes revolted against the aristocracy in 1762..Vigan's two sections during the mid-19th-century indigo boom—one for the meztizos and the other for the naturales—remain distinct.
Migration
Spanish colonizers used free labor in the development of Ilocos Sur..Resentment of free labor triggered sporadic revolts, and those who refused to be slaves or tenants left the region for Abra and the Cagayan Valley..From 1898 to the first decade of the 20th century, covered oxcarts moved to the rich plains of Pangasinan, Nueva Ecija and Tarlac..Children were told tales of Lam-ang, Angalo, Aran, Juan Sadot and other legendary Ilocano characters..Folk songs such as ""Pamulinawen"", ""Manang Biday"", and ""Dungdungwen Kanto Unay, Unay"" became popular.
During the second phase of Ilocano migration, from 1908 to 1946, surplus labor migrated to the plantations of Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast..Ilocos Sur's population density was 492 per square mile at the height of migration, which made it the most densely-populated region in the Philippines except for Manila..The last group of labor migrants to Hawaii was in 1946, when 7,365 men were recruited by the United States Department of Labor..Vigan was the recruiting center..More than eighty percent of Filipinos in Hawaii are of Ilocano origin.
Economic prosperity
The first half of the 19th century was an economic boom for Ilocos Sur..During this period, the cotton, tobacco and indigo industries were encouraged by the government..With the operations of the Royal Company of the Philippines (Real Compañía de Filipinas), the textile industry was developed on a large scale and the abolition of the tobacco monopoly accelerated economic progress.
Revolts
The beginning of Spanish rule to the first decade of the nineteenth century was characterized by revolts against tribute, forced labor and monopolies..The Ilocos revolt (1762–1763), better known as Silang's Revolt, was aimed at the babaknangs and the alcalde-mayor of Vigan..After Diego Silang's assassination on May 28, 1763, his wife Maria Josefa Gabriela continued the fight until she was captured and hanged on September 20, 1763.
On March 25, 1898, Isabelo Abaya began an uprising in Candón and raised a red flag in the town plaza as a response to Spanish abuses and oppression..A revolutionary government was established, and several other revolts followed..The Spanish sent shock troops to re-occupy Candon, and most of the leaders and participants in the uprising who surrendered were arrested and executed.
Philippine Revolution and Philippine-American War
Ilocos Sur, like other Philippine provinces, rallied behind Emilio Aguinaldo in the 1896 Philippine Revolution..When Vigan was captured, the rebels made Bishop's Palace their headquarters..On March 21, 1898, Mariano Acosta of Candón established a provincial revolutionary government..When General Aguinaldo returned from exile in Hong Kong, he sent Manuel Tinio to wage guerilla warfare on the Americans..Vigan was Tinio's headquarters until it was occupied by the U.S. 45th Infantry Division under James Parker on December 4, 1899..Gregorio del Pilar died on December 2, 1899, in the Battle of Tirad Pass.
American invasion
Under the Americans, a civil government was established in Ilocos Sur on September 1, 1901..Mena Crisólogo, a delegate to the Malolos Congress, was the first provincial governor.
Japanese occupation
On December 10, 1941, a contingent of Japanese Imperial forces landed in Mindoro, Vigan, Santa, Pandan and Caoayan..In Cervantes, the Battle of Bessang Pass was fought between Tomoyuki Yamashita's forces and the U.S. 21st Infantry; it was the greatest victory by Filipino guerrillas over the Japanese Imperial Army in World War II..The guerrillas mounted a series of attacks that lasted for almost six months in early 1945.
Marcos era
Much of the history of Ilocos Sur during the 21 years of the Marcos dictatorship are not well-documented, with the most prominent portrayals of Ilocos Sur history preferring to skip from the years immediately after Philippine independence in the 1940s, jumping straight to contemporary times.
But the most prominent protests and incidents of the period actually took place before 1972, and involved the Marcos administration's support for local strongmen: ""50""
Bantay incident
Marcos' victory in the 1965 Presidential Elections had required that he gain political control of the north as a solid voting block, which meant forming alliances with the most prominent local ""warlords"" of the time
But a turning point took place in May 1970 with the so-called ""Bantay Incident."".The saka-saka assassinated a former mayor of Bantay, the town next to Vigan, in 1969, and then in May 1970, burned the villages of Ora Este and Ora Centro in retaliation for their residents' support for Crisologo's opponent Chavit Singson during the 1996 elections..: ""51""

This section is missing information about economic indicators (e.g..per capita income, unemployment, etc)..Please expand the section to include this information..Further details may exist on the talk page..(October 2021)
Products and industries
The people are engaged in farming, producing food crops, mostly rice, corn, vegetable, root crops, and fruits..Non-food crops include tobacco, cotton, and tigergrass..Cottage industries include loom weaving, furniture making, jewelry making, ceramics, blacksmithing, and food processing.
Agriculture
Rice grains being dried on a road in San Esteban.
Ilocos Sur's economy is agrarian, but its 2,647 square kilometres (1,022 sq mi) of unfertile land is not enough to support a population of 338,579.
Agricultural crops such as rice, corn tobacco and fruit trees dominate their farm industries..Secondary crops are camote and cassava, sugar cane and onions.
The rapidly growing population, the decreasing fertility of the soil, and the long period between the planting and harvesting season, have forced the people to turn to manufacture and trade..Many Ilocanos go to the Cagayán valley, Central Plains and Mindanao to sell Ilocano woven cloth.
Virginia leaf tobacco is still a premier cash crop, after a windfall brought about by the Tobacco Subsidy Law authored by Congressman Floro Crisologo in 1964,
Weaving is the most extensive handicraft, once bolstered by the installation of the NDC Textile Mills in Narvacan which supplied the weavers with yarn.
Other industries are burnay and slipper making in Vigan, furniture, cabinet, and statue making in San Vicente, mortar and pestle making in San Esteban, and bolo making in Santa.
Infrastructure
Electricity
All municipalities in Ilocos Sur are electrified, courtesy of the Ilocos Sur Electric Cooperative (ISECO).
Education
Ilocos Sur has 547 public schools including five general high schools, one university, one agricultural college and 56 private schools, 16 of which are Catholic.
Culture
The Ilocos Sur Museum, founded on August 22, 1970, has a collection of cultural treasures which include art include paintings, centuries-old sculptures, pieces of carved furniture, and relics of Spanish European and Chinese cultures that had influenced Ilocano life for centuries.
Chapters of Philippine history and religion are found in the Crisólogo collections which includes family heirlooms, centuries –old ""santos"" (religious statuettes made of wood or ivory), other ivory images, Vienna furniture, marble-topped tables, ancient-carved beds, rare Chinese porcelains, jars and jarlettes, lamps, Muslim brass wares, and Spanish and Mexican coins.
The Syquia collections, including then President Elpidio Quirino's memorabilia, vie in quality with the Crisólogo collections..But in the midst of a fire scare in Vigan in the late 1908s and 1990s, the relics in the Syquia Mansion were transferred to Manila for safekeeping.
UNESCO Recognitions in Ilocos Sur

Iloilo  (), officially the Province of Iloilo (Hiligaynon: Kapuoran sang Iloilo; Kinaray-a: Kapuoran kang Iloilo; Cebuano: Lalawigan sa Iloilo; Filipino: Lalawigan ng Iloilo; Spanish: Província de Iloílo),  is a province in the Philippines located in the Western Visayas region..Its capital and largest city is Iloilo City, the regional center of Western Visayas..Iloilo occupies the southeast portion of the Visayan island of Panay and is bordered by the province of Antique to the west, Capiz to the north, the Jintotolo Channel to the northeast, the Guimaras Strait to the east, and the Iloilo Strait and Panay Gulf to the southwest.
Just off Iloilo's southeast coast is the island province of Guimaras, once part of Iloilo but now an independent province..Across Panay Gulf and Guimaras Strait is Negros Occidental, occupying the northwestern half of the larger island of Negros..Iloilo City, its capital, is the center of the Iloilo–Guimaras Metropolitan Area or Metro Iloilo–Guimaras, and is geographically located in the province and grouped under it by the Philippine Statistics Authority, but remains politically independent from the provincial government..According to the 2020 census, the population of the province (excluding Iloilo City) is 2,051,899..If Iloilo City is included, the population is 2,509,525 in total.
Iloilo is known for its rich history and cultural heritage..It is home to many Spanish-era historic sites, including the Miag-ao Church, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Philippines..The province is also home to several other prominent structures, including the San Joaquin Campo Santo, San Joaquin Church, and Santa Barbara Church, all recognized as National Cultural Treasures by the National Museum of the Philippines.
The province offers diverse attractions, from well-preserved colonial structures in the south to pristine beaches and islands in the north, namely the Bantigue Sand Bar, the Tangke Lagoon, Cabugao Island, and Antonia Island, all part of the Islas de Gigantes..Additionally, Sicogon Island, situated south of the group of islands, has gained popularity as a luxury tourist destination.
Etymology
The name of the province is derived from Iloilo City, which in turn is derived from the older name ""Ilong-ilong"" (Philippine Spanish: Ilong̃-ílong̃) meaning ""nose-like"", in English referring to the promontory between two rivers (Iloilo and Batiano) where the Fort San Pedro and the 17th-century Spanish port were located.
History
Early history
See also: Maragtas, Madja-as, Early historic coastal city-states and polities of Philippines, Indian cultural influences in early Philippine polities, Greater India, and Indosphere
No pre-Hispanic written accounts of Iloilo and Panay island exist today..Oral tradition, in the form of recited epics like the Hinilawod, has survived to a small degree..A few recordings of these epic poems exist..The most notable are the works of noted Filipino Anthropologist Felipe Jocano.
While no current archaeological evidence exist describing pre-Hispanic Iloilo, an original work by Pedro Alcantara Monteclaro published in 1907 called Maragtas details the alleged accounts of the founding of the various pre-Hispanic polities on Panay Island..The book is based on oral and written accounts available to the author at the time.
According to Maragtas, Madja-as was founded after ten datus fled Borneo and landed on Panay Island..The book then goes on to detail their subsequent purchase of the coastal lands in which they settled from the native Ati people.
Datu Paiburong, one of the ten fleeing datus, established a settlement and named it Irong-Irong after an islet of the same name on the Batiano River.

Spanish colonial era
Spain eventually succeeded on conquering of the island of Panay when Spanish conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi moved his headquarters from the island of Cebu and creating the first Spanish settlement in the island in Ogtong in 1566..This is mainly due in part to the rivalries between the Bisaya and the Moro, of which the former found an ally in Spanish against the latter..The Bisayas accepted alliances with Spain, to defend themselves against the enslaving Moros..To this end, Iloilo contributed troops in the Castille War against the Sultanate of Brunei.
In 1581, the encomienda in Ogtong was moved to La Villa Rica de Arevalo, because of frequent coastal raids by the Dutch privateers..Furthermore, an attack in the year 1600 (Part of the Spanish–Moro conflict) where there was a large Muslim armada to destroy Iloilo City, led by two Moros named Sirungan and Salikala who lead the Muslim force of 70 ships and 4,000 warriors that had raided and attacked several Visayan islands in order to abduct slaves to sell to their allies in the Sultanate of Demak and the Sultanate of Malacca, eventually caused the move of the city center further on to the mouth of the Irong-Irong river founding what is now Iloilo City and constructing Fort San Pedro to defend it in 1616.
Nevertheless, when the 4,000 Moros led by Sirungan and Salikala tried to attack Iloilo City they were repulsed with heavy losses in the town of Arevalo by a force of 1,000 Hiligaynon warriors and 70 Mexican arquebusiers under the command of Juan García de Sierra, the Spanish officer who died in the battle..The Spanish Christianized the area.

Soon, the area itself began to prosper, due to its successful textile and sugar industry..As a result, it received Chinese immigrants from the west (that worked for its trades) and Latinos from the ports of Mexico in the east (to man its military installations)..The Jesuits soon built a school for Spanish and Visayan boys in Tigbauan, Iloilo..: 113
American invasion era
During the American colonial period, Iloilo became a home to many firsts: including the first department stores and cinema theaters in the Commonwealth of the Philippines.
Japanese occupation era
Iloilo experienced severe devastation during the events of World War II..The Japanese built ""comfort stations"" in Iloilo in 1942, where they imprisoned Filipino ""comfort women"" who they routinely gang-raped, brutalized, and murdered for entertainment..: 110
Philippine independence
Iloilo became a province of the newly fledged Republic of the Philippines when the archipelago gained independence from the United States on July 4, 1946.

Isabela, officially the Province of Isabela (Ilocano: Probinsia ti Isabela; Ibanag: Provinsia na Isabela; Tagalog: Lalawigan ng Isabela), is the second largest province in the Philippines in land area located in the Cagayan Valley..Its capital and the largest local government unit is the city of Ilagan..It is bordered by the provinces of Cagayan to the north, Kalinga to the northwest, Mountain Province to the central-west, Ifugao and Nueva Vizcaya to the southwest, Quirino, Aurora and the independent city of Santiago to the south, and the Philippine Sea to the east.
This primarily agricultural province is the rice and corn granary of Luzon due to its plain and rolling terrain..In 2012, the province was declared as the country's top producer of corn with 1,209,524 metric tons.
Isabela is the 9th richest province in the Philippines as of 2021.
Etymology
The province was named after Isabella II, who was queen regnant of Spain from September 29, 1833, until September 30, 1868, when she was deposed in the Glorious Revolution, and her formal abdication two years later.
There have been proposals to change the name to something more indigenous, but these were rejected by the people of Isabela.
History
The province of Isabela used to be a vast rainforest where numerous indigenous ethnolinguistic groups lived..Many of the same ethnic groups still live in the province..Shell midden sites and other archaeological sites throughout the province constitute the material culture of those groups during the classical era.
Spanish colonial period
During the Spanish era, prior to 1856, the Cagayan Valley was divided into only two provinces: Cagayan and Nueva Vizcaya..The Province of Cagayan at that time consisted of all towns from Tumauini to Aparri in the north..All other towns from Ilagan southward to Aritao composed the Province of the old Nueva Vizcaya..In order to facilitate the work of the Catholic missionaries in the evangelization of the Cagayan Valley, a royal decree was issued on May 1, 1856, creating the Province of Isabela consisting of the towns of Gamu, Old Angadanan (now Alicia), Bindang (now Roxas) and Camarag (now Echague), Carig (now Santiago City) and Palanan, all detached from the Province of Nueva Vizcaya; while Cabagan and Tumauini were taken from the Province of Cagayan..The exception is Palanan, which was established in 1625 by Spanish forces who arrived by ship from the Pacific coastal town of Baler in Tayabas province (now part of Aurora)..Thus, Palanan was originally a part of Pampanga
The province was placed under the jurisdiction of a governor (Lieutenant Colonel of Cavalry Francisco Contreras y Urtasun) with Ilagan as the capital, where it remains up to present..It was initially called Isabela de Luzón to differentiate from other places in the Philippines bearing the name of Isabela..The new province was named after Queen Isabella II of Spain..During that time, the Spanish controlled only the areas along the Cagayan River, leaving the Mallig Plants, the Magat River and the Sierra Madre Mountains to Gaddang tribes.
The Atta or Negritos were the first people in valley..They were later moved to the uplands or variably assimilated by the Austronesians, from whom the Ibanags, Itawes, Yogads, Gaddangs, Irayas, Malawegs, and Paranans descended - who actually came from one ethnicity..These are the people found by the Spaniards in the different villages along the rivers all over Cagayan Valley, including present Isabela..The Spaniards rightly judged that these various villagers came from a single racial stock and decided to make the Ibanag language the lingua franca, both civilly and ecclesiastically for the entire people of Cagayan which they called collectively as the Cagayanes which later was transliterated to become Cagayanos.
Various other peoples, mainly the Ilocanos, Pangasinenses, Kapampangans and Tagalogs, as well as Visayans, Moros and even foreigners like the Chinese, Indians, Arabs, Spaniards and others were further infused to the native Cagayanes to become the modern Cagayano, and Isabeliño in the exact province, that we know today.
American invasion era
Although the province did not play a major role in the revolt against Spain, it is in Palanan that the final pages of the Philippine Revolution were written when United States troops, led by General Frederick Funston, finally captured General Emilio Aguinaldo on March 23, 1901..To commemorate this historical event, in 1962 the town officials constructed a monument by the Palanan City Hall, right on the spot where General Aguinaldo was captured, to memorialize the historic event..The monument was inaugurated on June 12, 1962, Philippine Independence Day, and still stands.
Isabela was re-organized as a province under the American military government through Act No..210, passed August 24, 1901.
The Americans built schools and other buildings and instituted changes in the overall political system..However, the province's economy remained predominantly agricultural, with rice replacing corn and tobacco as the principal crop.
Japanese occupation era
World War II stagnated the province's economic growth but it recovered dramatically after the war..In 1942, Imperial Japanese forces occupied Isabela..In 1945, the liberation of Isabela commenced with the arrival of the Philippine Commonwealth troops under the 11th Infantry Regiment, Philippine Army, USAFIP-NL and the recognized guerrillas attacked by the Japanese Imperial forces in World War II.
A new wave of immigration began in the late 19th and 20th centuries with the arrival of the Ilokano who came in large numbers..They now constitute the largest group in the province, and it was only in this large-scale Ilocano immigration & settlement that made Ilocano language replaced Ibanag as the lingua franca of the province..Other ethnic groups followed that made Isabela the ""Melting Pot of the Northern Philippines"".
Postwar era
This section needs expansion..You can help by adding to it..(May 2024)
In the years after the Second World War, Isabela was ruled by the Dy family for 35 years (1969-2004)..The dynasty was started by the patriarch of the family, Faustino N. Dy Sr., who served as the mayor of Cauayan from 1965 to 1969 and sat as provincial governor for 22 years (1969–1992), surviving the initial attempts of President Ferdinand Marcos to remove him for being a member of the political opposition during the imposition of Martial Law in 1972 and winning reelection in 1988 after his removal by President Corazon Aquino after he had sided with Marcos in 1986.
During the Marcos dictatorship
Main articles: Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos and Human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship
By the first term of the first term of the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos, Isabela had become known among students activists for its remoteness and the poverty of its agricultural workers, making it a favorite destination for ""dissatisfied, alienated young activists."".The Armed Forces had a number of initial successes against the NPA in Isabela at this time, including the discovery of the Taringsing Documents in Cordon outlining plans for a communist takeover; and the failed landing of arms bound for the NPA in Palanan during the MV Karagatan incident in 1972..These incidents were cited as some of the justifications for the declaration of Martial Law by Marcos later that year.
With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years.
The province of Isabela became a particular center of both conflict and protest when Marcos cronies Danding Cojuangco and Antonio Carag managed to block a Spanish-era grant which was supposed to see the return of Hacienda San Antonio and Hacienda Santa Isabel in Ilagan to local farmers..Cojuangco and Carag purchased the two haciendas themselves, displacing tens of thousands of farmers who were supposed to get those lands back a hundred years after the Spanish acquired them.
In its desire to serve its parishioners, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ilagan hosted a Social Action Center which would help the farmers..In the Social Action Center's newsletter, the ""Courier,"" researcher Sabino Padilla Jr. documented and exposed the ways by which Cojuangco, Carag, the provincial government, and the military harassed the farmers who were supposed to get the land..This all led to a protest march in joined by 12,000 protesters from all over Isabela, and eventually, for 4,000 farmers to finally get the titles to their land..But it also earned the ire of the administration.
In 1982, Padilla and 12 others were arrested by the regime and jailed under poor conditions at the Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya Stockade of the Philippine Constabulary until almost the end of the Marcos regime.
It was also during the dictatorship that  Marcos began awarding logging concessions to his cronies in the areas of the Sierra Madre region, which heralded the beginning of widescale deforestation and other environmental problems that affect the province since then, despite Marcos creating the Palanan Wilderness Area in 1978 which was later expanded by President Fidel V. Ramos to become the Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park in 1997.
In 1975, construction began on the Magat Dam on the boundary of Ramon, Isabela with neighboring Ifugao Province, becoming a catchbasin for 8 rivers upstream in Ifugao
After the People Power Revolution in 1986, many of the activists who had joined the underground movement decided to ""surface,"" as the new administration of Corazon Aquino released political prisoners and initiated peace talks.
Contemporary
This section needs expansion..You can help by adding to it..(May 2024)
Following the 1986 People Power Revolution, known as the current Fifth Philippine Republic, under the 1987 Philippine Constitution, various changes have been attempted since then in the province.
Dy Sr. was succeeded by his son, Benjamin G. Dy, in the gubernatorial seat from 1992 to 2001..Another Dy took over the gubernatorial seat in 2001 when Faustino Dy Jr. won the 2001 elections after having served as the district representative of the 2nd Legislative District of the province from 1992 to 2001..It was only in the 2004 elections that the family's control of the gubernatorial seat ended when Grace Padaca, a former journalist, won over Faustino Dy Jr. She was the first woman to serve as the governor of the province..After serving for six years (2004-2010), Padaca was defeated in the 2010 National Elections by Faustino ""Bojie"" G. Dy III who served as governor of the province for three consecutive terms (2010-2019)..He was then succeeded by Rodolfo ""Rodito"" Albano III, a member of the Albano dynasty that dominates Isabela's 1st congressional district.
In July 1994, the municipality of Santiago was converted into an independent-component city in the province of Isabela..Several attempts were made to revert the status into a component city but did not go through..Santiago is geographically located in Isabela but not under the administration of the province..Its electorates are prohibited to participate in the provincial-level elections except in the 4th legislative district of Isabela where the city belongs for congress representation.
In 1995, Republic Act 7891 was passed, legislating that Isabela be divided into two new provinces: Isabela del Norte and Isabela del Sur.
In 1999, the municipality of Ilagan, also serving as the capital town of the province, sought to become a city..The plebiscite held on March 14, 1999, turned down its first bid for cityhood..The majority of the people voted no in that event..In its second attempt to cityhood, the campaign did not go through due to lack of concurrency in the senate in 2006..Finally, Ilagan became a city, after its third move gained 96% of the votes in a plebiscite conducted on August 11, 2012.
In 2001, the municipality of Cauayan became a component city in the province of Isabela.
In 2019, the province was reorganized into six districts, thereby increasing the number of legislative districts from four to six..Cities and municipalities were retained and others were reapportioned to the current district assignments.
2020 Ulysses Flood
Further information: Typhoon Vamco
Cagayan has been heavily impacted by changing weather pattern changes resulting from climate change,
In November 2020, Typhoon Vamco (locally known in the Philippines as Typhoon Ulysses) crossed the country, dams from all around Luzon neared their spilling points, forcing them to release large amounts of water into their impounds including Magat Dam..The dam opened all of its 7 gates at 24 metres (79 ft), releasing over 5,037 cubic metres (1,331,000 US gal) of water into the Cagayan River flooding numerous riverside towns.
Because there was very little media coverage of the flooding in the area in the wake of the COVID-19 lockdown in Luzon and the Shutdown of ABS-CBN broadcasting earlier that year,
Geography
Isabela comprises an aggregate land area of 12,414.93 square kilometres (4,793.43 sq mi),
View of the Sierra Madre
The province is divided into three physiographic areas..The eastern area, straddled by the Sierra Madre mountain range, is rugged and thickly forested..A substantial portion is uncharted..These unexplored hinterlands are home to a rich variety of flora and fauna, and some are under government reservations..It is home to one of the world's largest remaining low-altitude rainforests, with numerous unknown endemic species of flora and fauna and biological diversity in the protected area known as the Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park.
The highest point of the province is located near the border with Cagayan..Mount Dos Cuernos peak has an elevation of 1,785 metres (5,856 ft) located in San Pablo near the border with Maconacon..Other notable peaks in the Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park is Mount Cresta in Divilacan with an elevation of 1,672 metres (5,486 ft).
The western area is a fertile valley hemmed by the Central Cordillera..It is crisscrossed by the mighty Cagayan River, Siffu River, and Magat River.

Ilagan-Divilacan Road
The construction of an 82-kilometer route across the Sierra Madre National Park is intended to improve access to the province's three coastal communities..The project's authorized budget contract, worth P1.5 billion, will traverse across the foothills of the Northern Sierra Madre mountain ranges, which cover 359,486 hectares..The idea is to rehabilitate an ancient logging route that was utilized until the 1990s by a defunct logging firm..It will begin in Barangay Sindon Bayabo in Ilagan City and end at Barangay Dicatian in Divilacan's seaside town..The project is scheduled to conclude in 2021.
The secluded coastal settlements of Divilacan, Palanan, and Maconacon are frequently accessible only by boat or plane, making them difficult to reach at times of emergencies and calamities..There are no highways connecting Ilagan's capital city to the coastal districts, denying locals access to basic commodities and social services such as health care..Once completed, the route is projected to bolster coastal economies, citing Divilacan's 119-hectare beach and freshwater areas that have attracted tourists..Resolution No..11 of the Protected Area Management Board (PAMB) reclassifies areas of the Sierra Madre as a special-use zone..Additionally, the Agta and Dumagat communities in the vicinity have signed a memorandum of understanding with the provincial administration expressing their support for the road project..At least 1,800 Agta and Dumagat have made their homes in park areas..However, the road's impact on the protected forest has upset neighbors, who believe the project will harm the region's woods and ecosystems..The project has been delayed in recent years due to worries about the road's possible environmental impact..The Cagayan Valley Regional Development Council required that the road's proponents conduct a comprehensive analysis of the road's impact on the area's biodiversity.

Kalinga (IPA: ), officially the Province of Kalinga (Ilocano: Probinsia ti Kalinga; Tagalog: Lalawigan ng Kalinga), is a landlocked province in the Philippines situated within the Cordillera Administrative Region in Luzon..Its capital is Tabuk and borders Mountain Province to the south, Abra to the west, Isabela to the east, Cagayan to the northeast, and Apayao to the north..Kalinga and Apayao are the result of the 1995 partitioning of the former province of Kalinga-Apayao which was seen to better service the respective needs of the various indigenous peoples in the area.
President Emilio Aguinaldo proclaimed Lubuagan town the seat of government for 73 days from March 6, 1900, to May 18, 1900, before finally fleeing to Palanan.
Etymology
The province's name is derived from the Ibanag and Gaddang noun ""kalinga"", which means ""enemy"", ""fighter"", or ""headtaker"".
History
American occupation
Kalinga was taken from Cagayan and Isabela provinces and established by the US Government through Philippine Commission Act No..1642 on May 9, 1907, as a sub-province of Lepanto-Bontoc.
Kalinga province was named after Kalinga people, a tribe which migrated to Philippines from Kalinga Kingdom of ancient India after Kalinga war in 261 BCE in different phases and accepted local culture resulting fusion of distinct culture some of customs are similar to those of Kalinga or Odia people of present day Odisha in India..Earlier it called Kalinga Kingdom, a very powerful kingdom of India having strong maritime history with south east Asia from 700BCE to 1400 CE.
Kalinga was later organized as one of the sub-provinces of Mountain Province, created by Act No..1876.
In the early years, the subprovince underwent series of territorial changes..Part of Kalinga was transferred to another sub-province Bontoc through Executive Order No..53 in 1914..In the municipal district of Pinukpuk, barrios were moved to Balbalan in 1926; as well as parts of it to Conner in Apayao in 1927.
Postwar era
Kalinga became part of a province along with Apayao when the old Mountain Province was divided into four separate provinces through Republic Act No..4695 in 1966.
During the Marcos dictatorship
The beginning months of the 1970s marked a period of turmoil and change in the Philippines, as well as in Kalinga-Apayao.
With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years.
The 24 April 1980 murder of Macli-ing Dulag became a turning point when coverage of the murder led to public outrage..It was the first time since the 1972 declaration of Martial Law where the mainstream Philippine press managed to report on the arrests of civilians under Martial Law,
After the People Power Revolution
After Marcos' 21 years in power were finally ended by the civilian-led People Power Revolution in 1986, many of the activists who had joined the underground movement decided to ""surface,"" as the new administration of Corazon Aquino released political prisoners and initiated peace talks.
Another event in 1986 marked the beginning of political change in the region, however - the splitting of the Cordillera People's Liberation Army from the New People's Army..Former Catholic priest Conrado Balweg, who had left his calling and joined the NPA in 1979, had been having disagreements with the NPA leadership over tactics and objectives in the Cordillera for four years when he finally decided to split from the NPA in early April 1986,
Peace accord and creation of the Cordillera Autonomous Region
In September 1986, the CPLA signed the Mount Data Peace Accord with the government, which led to the creation of what became called the Cordillera Autonomous Region, although attempts to ratify actual autonomy in the region have failed due to non-ratification during plebiscites.
Along with Abra, Kalinga-Apayao became part of the territories in the Cordillera Administrative Region which was created through Executive Order No..220 in 1987.
Creation as a province
Kalinga was converted into a province on May 8, 1995 by virtue of RA No..7878 when majority of the voters in Kalinga-Apayao approved in a plebiscite the division of the province into two.
Contemporary
The capital town Tabuk became a component city by virtue of Republic Act No..9404 which sought to convert the town into a city..The law was ratified on June 23, 2007..However, the cityhood status was lost twice in the years 2008 and 2010 after the LCP questioned the validity of the cityhood law..The cityhood status was reaffirmed after the court finalized its ruling on February 15, 2011 which declared the cityhood law constitutional.
On February 15, 2023, the province was certified by Guinness World Records with two titles: largest gong ensemble (in its second attempt) with 3,440 male participants, and largest banga (clay pot) dance with 4,681 female participants; both performed in a program called ""Awong Chi Gangsa, Agtu'n Chi Banga"" (A call of a thousand gongs, the dance of a thousand pots) in Tabuk, as part of the 4th Bodong Festival coinciding with the province's 28th founding anniversary.
Geography

Culture

There are many sub-tribes in the province..The strong sense of tribal membership and filial loyalty results in frequent tribal unrest and occasional outright war..Due to the mountainous terrain and warrior-culture of the people, the Kalinga were able to preserve their culture despite centuries of occupation in the lowlands by the Spaniards, Americans, and the Japanese.
On February 22, 2019, the Department of Tourism announced the bid of Digdiga Ni Tupayya, a Kalinga courtship dance, to be included in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.

La Union (Tagalog pronunciation: ), officially the Province of La Union (Ilocano: Probinsia ti La Union; Pangasinan: Luyag/Probinsia na La Union;
Tagalog: Lalawigan ng La Union), is a province in the Philippines located in the Ilocos Region in the island of Luzon..Its capital is the City of San Fernando, which also serves as the regional center of the Ilocos Region.
The province is bordered by Ilocos Sur to the north, Benguet to the east, Pangasinan to the south, and to the west by the shores of the South China Sea.
History
This section needs expansion..You can help by adding to it..(June 2016)
Early history
See also: History of the Philippines (900–1565)
During the pre-colonial era, the coastal plains of northwestern La Union and Ilocos Sur stretching from the town of ""Tagudan"" (Tagudin) in the north to Sudipen, Namacpacan (Luna), Bangar, ""Basnutan"" (Bacnotan), and ""Purao"" or ""Puraw"" (Balaoan) in the south, and along the riverbanks of the Amburayan River – were the early settlement of the ""Samtoy"" or the ""Ilocanos"" in La Union.
Thus according to William Henry Scott, ""the northern section of La Union was an emporium and renowned for the exchange of Igorot gold and gold mines"", involving merchants often from the Chinese, Japanese, Igorots, and Tagalogs during the early settlement period..Rice, cotton, gold, wax, iron, glass beads, silk (abel), honey, ceramics, and stoneware jars known as burnáy were all traded goods.""
Furthermore, the southern coastal section of La Union was identified as ""Aroo"" or ""Agoho"" (Agoo)..Agoo was the northern section of Caboloan (Pangasinan), and a settlement of people of the ""same race as those of Pangasinan, encompassing the settlements of ""Atuley"" (San Juan)"", ""San Fernando"", ""Bauang"", ""Caba"", the settlement of ""Alingay or Alinguey"" (Aringay), ""Santo Tomas"", and ""Rosario"".
These people traded actively trading with their Ilocano and Igorot neighbors and traders from China, Japan, and Southeast Asia for a long time before the age of colonization, as evidenced by the porcelain and pottery excavated from the site of the Catholic church during its renovation and now housed in the Museo de Iloko.
Later, Japanese traders and fisherfolk arrived in the Philippines and established a settlement..La Union's coast was shaped in such a way at the time that it provided a good harbor for foreign vessels entering Lingayen Gulf.
In the highlands of La Union is home of the Igorot people mainly the Kankaney and Ibaloi.
Spanish colonial era
See also: Spanish Colonial Era (Philippines)
A year after Adelantado Miguel Lopez de Legazpi made Manila the capital of the Philippines on June 24, 1571, the Spaniards started the colonization in Northern Luzon ""to pacify the people in it"".
In June, 1572, the conquistadores led by Juan de Salcedo (grandson of Legazpi) sailing the Angalakan River and landed in “Aroo” or “Agoho” present Agoo, then a part of Pangasinan..Juan de Salcedo saw three Japanese ships, he tracked them down until they landed in a Japanese settlement..The Japanese were permitted to stay after paying tribute..As a result of the incident, Agoo was dubbed ""El Puerto de Japon"" or ""Japanese Port"", because enterprising Japanese and Chinese merchants have been trading with the natives through this port..Agoo was highly involved in commerce with other Southeast Asian countries in the region.
In her book ""Pangasinan 1572–1800"", Rosario Mendoza-Cortes states that La Union specifically Agoo was the region's principal port of call for Japanese and Chinese traders, with Sual, Pangasinan, as the only other contender..This was due to the presence of a Japanese colony..Traders at Agoo, after all, would have access to a larger number of people, and it was closer to China and Japan..The principal export from the region was deer pelts, which were shipped to Japan..When the Spanish closed the Philippines to foreign trade, Agoo's function as an ancient port began to deteriorate..When the port of Agoo was eventually closed, the Japanese would leave, but not before teaching the locals about fish farming, rice cultivation, deerskin tanning, duck breeding, and weapon production.
The Spaniards marched up north without any resistance..They had their first taste of the Ilocanos' bravery and fighting heart during a historic Battle in Purao (literally, ""white"" and maybe due to the white sands of the beach) now known as Balaoan..The Spaniards befriended the Ilocanos who reluctantly acceded to Spanish rule.
A secret society of insurrectos was organized in the town of Balaoan..Its purpose was to fight and revolt against the Spanish Government in the area..On the eve of the revolution, a traitor told the Spanish of their plan..The Spanish soldiers, without any investigation, arrested seven members of the secret society and executed them the same night..Only one, Fernando Ostrea, escaped with leg wounds..He informed the people about what had happened..In memory of the seven Martyrs, a masonic lodge, Siete Martires Lodge No..177, was organized.
Formation in 1850
La Union was formed on March 2, 1850, and became the 34th province of the Philippines.
After Cebu became the first provincia in 1565, new provinces have been created by the Spaniards..Three main functions were considered so: political-civil administration, ecclesiastical governance and geographical considerations..For more than two and one-half centuries, the original llocos province remained intact until 1818 when it split into llocos Norte and Ilocos Sur..In 1846, Abra was created by Governor General Narciso Zaldua Claveria.
Governor General Claveria was a visionary administrator..He believed that combining three contiguous areas that are far from their respective provincial capitals was a viable solution to the demands of political-civil administration..He also saw the territory's agricultural and commercial growth potentials..And the kicker was the extension of Hispanic civilization and Christianity to the area..Bangar, Namacpacan (Luna) and Balaoan in the southern portion of llocos Sur was quite a distance from the cabezera of Vigan and in almost like manner, Sto..Tomas, Agoo, Aringay, Caba, Bauang, Naguilian, San Fernando, San Juan and Bacnotan were that far from Pangasinan's capital of Lingayen..The 40–45 rancherias in the depths of Central Cordillera of the Benguet (Eastern Pais del Igorotes) district bordered by the three Ilocos Sur towns and the nine of Pangasinan have even worse problems.
Thus on October 29, 1849, Governor General Claveria signed the proposal (promovido) to unite the Pangasinan-Ilocos-Cordillera areas into a new province called La Union (the official name designated by Claveria himself)..For 124 days, high and important Spanish colonial officers studied and deliberated on the proposition to create La Union or not..On March 2, 1850, Governor General Antonio Maria Blanco signed the Superior Decreto that founded La Union – the 34th province since the founding of Cebu in 1565..It was classified as a gobierno politico-militar (Political-Military Government)..Blanco appointed, on March 4, 1850, Captain Toribio Ruiz de la Escalera (Claveria's former trusted aide de camp) as the first Gobernador Military y Politico..La Union is the union of lands, people, cultures and resources..On April 18, 1854, Queen Isabella II of Spain issued the royal decree (real orden) from Madrid confirming Blanco's Superior Decreto.
By 1860, there was a dramatic progress in commerce and agriculture in the province primarily because of Tobacco..Spanish authorities banked on the prized leaf for further economic development..The industry was so lucrative that a Tobacco Monopoly was established..All Tobacco leaves were strictly monitored and bought exclusively by the government at a fixed price.
1898 Philippine Revolution
See also: Philippine Revolution
By 1896, the people of La Union had enough of the Spanish atrocities..The torture of the native priests, Padres Adriano Garces of Balaoan, Mariano Gaerlan of San Fernando and Mariano Dacanay of Bacnotan; the execution of the Balaoan Siete Martires, a majority of whom are ancestors of former La Union Board Member Joaquin C. Ostrea Jr.; the persecution of Masons, whose membership included the elite natives; and others have all the more agitated the people to unite and fight their masters for three centuries.
On May 22, 1898, a gunshot killed the much-hated Friar Mariano Garcia of Santo Tomas, it was a shot heard in the whole province which eventually ignited the revolution in what the Spaniards used to call, ""Una Provincia Modelo"".
Led by Manuel Tinio y Bondoc, a boy general under the command of General Emilio Aguinaldo, the Spaniards were finally defeated in La Union, some of whom escaped and sought refuge in Vigan..With the help of the Americans, the Filipinos were finally freed from Spain only to find out later that they will be subjected to a new colonial rule.
A Revolutionary Government was established with Aguinaldo as president..Tinio acted as de facto governor of La Union but was later on replaced by Dr. Lucino Almeida as Presidente Provincial.
American invasion era

During the American occupation, Dr. Almeida was reappointed as provincial chief, only to be convicted and exiled after his revolutionary connections were discovered..In defense of their hard-fought freedom, the people of La Union resisted American power and maintained their allegiance to Aguinaldo..Due however to the superior American military firepower, the whole province and the whole archipelago were finally subdued and pacified.
The Americans prioritized education during their rule..Schools were massively constructed, and public education attracted the Filipinos..Democracy, which was given equal importance, facilitated the election of La Union's first Civil Governor in 1901 in the person of Don Joaquín Joaquino Ortega..Nine other equally able governors followed Don Joaquin before the outbreak of World War II: Joaquín Luna 1904–1907, Sixto Zandueta 1908–1919, Pío Ancheta 1919–1922, Thomas de Guzmán 1922 1923, 1928–1931, Juan Lucero 1923–1929, Mauro Ortiz 1931–1934, Juan Rivera 1934–1937, Francisco Nisce 1937–1940 and Bernardo Gapuz 1940..Just as when the Filipinos were awaiting independence, as promised by the Americans under the Tydings-Mcduffie Law, World War II exploded.

La Union had great strategic significance for both Allied and Japanese forces..The Filipinos fought side by side with the Americans..Amid the chaos and anarchy, three provincial chieftains rose to the occasion to lead the people of La Union, Gov..Bernardo Gapuz (1940), Gov..Jorge Camacho (1941–1942) and Gov..Bonifacio Tadiar (1942–1944).
Battle of Rosario (Japanese Invasion of Lingayen Gulf)
On December 22, 1941, the Japanese 4th Tank Regiment and the 47th Infantry Regiment under the command of Col. Isamu Yanagi, supported by a massive flotilla of navy ships tried to land in Agoo to make it one of three major beachheads for the Japanese Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, although weather dispersed their forces and made them deploy on a wide stretch of beach that ranged from Poro Point (San Fernando) to as far south as Damortis..These forces later met the commonwealth defence forces—consisting of the 26th Cavalry Regiment (Philippine Scouts), the Philippine 21st Division, the Philippine 11th Division, and the newly formed Philippine 71st Division—in what would later be called the Battle of Rosario.
Bacnotan
Invading Japanese soldiers arrived at Bacnotan on December 21, 1941, during the early days of World War II..On January 4, 1945, the tides of war changed in La Union as Filipino-American soldiers captured Baroro Bridge in Bacnotan, a strategic bridge that connects the rest of Northern Luzon to San Fernando..The victory ensured the liberation of La Union..It was followed by the historic Battle of San Fernando and Bacsil Ridge..Defeated, the Japanese Imperial Army retreated to Baguio where they joined their comrades and made their last stand.
The Battle of Bacsil Ridge

Volckmann, and the Japanese Imperial forces under by General Tomoyuki Yamashita.
The Battle of Bacsil Ridge ended the month-long battle for control of San Fernando..The Japanese defenders called the Hayashi Detachment, composed of 3,000 armed troops and 2,000 unarmed support forces, took hold of San Fernando and its surrounding areas which denied entry to the port of the city and a road leading to Baguio..As part of the San Fernando-Bacsil Operations, the 1st Battalion of 121st Infantry were sent to loosen the enemy positions starting late February with the assistance of the Allied Air Force.
The 1st Battalion made a general attack to the ridge on 16 March 1945 and fought the Japanese defenders until the capture of Bacsil on 19 March..On the same day, the 3rd battalion captured the Reservoir Hill..The Battle of Bacsil Ridge between the Filipino soldiers and recognized guerrillas and the Japanese Forces resulted in the recapture of the city of San Fernando, La Union..Which resulted in the capture of San Fernando, La Union on 23 March 1945, and Bacnotan, La Union and the military offensive throughout the province ended on 24 March after two months of fighting.
Liberation of Bauang

During the Marcos Dictatorship

Although economically affected by the rapid peso devaluation brought about by unbridled election spending heading into the 1969 presidential elections,
The powerful family factions which had dominated La Union politics since before the American colonial era largely remained in place, although the family of Congressman Jose D. Aspiras became much more prominent after he became Marcos’ Tourism Minister..The main political change was the increased power of regional and provincial offices of national agencies, whose directors were answerable directly to Marcos.
This technique used by Marcos to consolidate political power did not get much resistance in the Ilocos Region, and his successor Jose D. Aspiras was also a close associate of Marcos who was made Minister of Tourism after Martial Law was declared.
But there were still La Union natives who were willing to object to the authoritarian practices and abuses of the Marcos administration, despite personal risk.
Agoo, La Union, native Antonio L. Mabutas had become Archbishop of Davao by the time of Martial Law, and spoke actively against the human rights abuses of that time,

2010s tourism boom
See also: Tarlac–Pangasinan–La Union Expressway and Manuel Arguilla
From the mid-2000s to the early 2010s, an influx of entrepreneurs began putting up establishments such as boho-chic-style art hostels and third-wave coffeeshops in San Juan and Agoo.
Alongside the rising influence of social media outlets Twitter and Instagram, these factors led to a drastic tourism boom that made San Juan—previously been seen as just one of the Philippines' many surfing venues—a major backpacker's destination whose attractions centered on surfing and art.
San Juan began to be featured prominently in independent films such as Jay Abello's 2015 film Flotsam
Among Philippines literary circles, the town of Bauang has also become a pilgrimage site of sorts for celebrating the life of and works of writer and World War II martyr Manuel Arguilla, with writers visiting the author's hometown to experience the landscapes that inspired him, and which featured prominently in his stories.
Geography
Landscape in Rosario
La Union covers a total area of 1,497.70 square kilometres (578.27 sq mi) occupying the central‑southern section of the Ilocos Region in Luzon..The province is bordered by Ilocos Sur to the north, Benguet to the east, Pangasinan to the south, and to the west by the South China Sea.
La Union is 273 kilometres (170 mi) north of Metro Manila and 57 kilometres (35 mi) northwest of Baguio..The land area of the province is 149,770 hectares (370,100 acres).

Laguna
Laguna is notable as the birthplace of José Rizal, the country's de facto national hero..It has numerous natural and cultural attractions such as Cavinti Falls aka Pagsanjan Falls, the University of the Philippines Los Baños and the University of the Philippines Open University in Los Baños, the hot spring resorts of Calamba on the slopes of Mount Makiling, Pila historic town plaza, Taytay Falls in Majayjay, the wood carvings and papier-mâché created by the people of Paete, the annual Sampaguita Festival in San Pedro, the turumba of Pakil, the tsinelas footwear from Liliw, the Pandan Festival of Luisiana, the Seven Lakes of San Pablo, and the Nagcarlan Underground Cemetery in Nagcarlan.
Laguna is part of the Greater Manila Area alongside Cavite, Rizal, and Bulacan.
History
Early history
Pre-Hispanic settlement in the area can be dated to prehistoric times, as evidenced in the names of towns such as Pila, Laguna, whose name can be traced to the straight mounds of dirt that form the boundaries of the rice paddy, or Pilapil..The written history of the province of Laguna, (Lagoon in Spanish) and that of the Southern Tagalog region, dates to 900 AD..The Laguna Copperplate Inscription is the oldest known written document found in the Philippines..It notes that its subject was released from a debt to the King of Tondo.
A prominent figure during the time of pre-Hispanic contact is Gat Pangil, a powerful native ruler in the area..The towns of Bay, Pangil and Pakil were reputed to have once been a part of his domain, although accounts vary about his identity.
Spanish colonial era
The province of Laguna, which was formerly called La Laguna and La Provincia de la Laguna de Bay, was named after Laguna de Bay, the body of water that forms its northern boundary..Laguna de Bay, in turn, was named after the town of Bay, the first provincial capital..Captain Juan de Salcedo with a band of one hundred Spanish-Mexican soldiers conquered the province and its surrounding regions for Spain in 1571..The province of La Laguna comprised the modern province of Laguna, as well as parts of what are now known as Rizal and Quezon provinces.
In 1577, Spanish Franciscan missionaries arrived in Manila, and in 1578 they started evangelizing Laguna, Morong (now Rizal), Tayabas (now Quezon) and the Bicol Peninsula as part of the colonizing effort..Juan de Plasencia and Diego de Oropesa were the earliest Franciscans sent to these places..From 1580, the towns of Bay, Caliraya, Majayjay, Nagcarlan, Liliw, Pila, Santa Cruz, Lumban, Pangil and Siniloan were founded..During the time of Governor-General Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas, the province of La Laguna was divided into the following encomiendas:
Mirabago – Currently the areas surrounding, Liliw, and Nagcarlan.
Tabuco – Currently the areas surrounding San Pedro, Biñan, Santa Rosa, Cabuyao, and Calamba.
Taitay – Currently Taytay, Rizal.
Bay – The area surrounding Bay, Laguna, and Los Baños, Laguna.
Pila – The area that is now Pila, Victoria, Pililla, and Jalajala, Rizal
Mahaihai – Currently the area around Majayjay, Magdalena, and Luisiana
Lumbang – The largest encomienda, containing what is now known as Lumban, Santa Cruz, Paete, Pakil, Cavinti, and Pagsanjan.
Tayaval – Tayabas, now known as Quezon province.
Panguil – Now Pangil.
Sinaloa – The area surrounding Siniloan, Famy and Mabitac.
Morong – Currently the areas surrounding Morong, including the town of Santa Maria, formerly known as Caboan.
Nayun – Nayum, currently Tiaong, Quezon.
By 1591, there were approximately 48,400 people living in the province.
Laguna was the site of multiple engagements during the Sangley Rebellion, made up of Chinese-Filipino mestizos..Captain Don Luys de Velasco, aided by Spanish and Filipino forces, was successful in pursuing the rebels..Eventually the Chinese were able to kill Luys de Velasco and ten of his men, before securing themselves in San Pablo while waiting for reinforcement from the mainland..On October 20, 1603, Governor-General Pedro Bravo de Acuña then sent Captain Cristoval de Axqueta Menchaca to pursue and crush the rebellion and was successful after twenty days of fighting.
Around this time the hot springs of Los Baños and San Pablo were known to the Spanish, and a hospital was built in the area..By 1622, the hospital was notable enough to be mentioned by the Archbishop of Manila at the time, Miguel García Serrano in his letter to King Philip IV.
In 1639, a second rebellion involving the Chinese occurred, and the rebels fortified themselves in the highlands of Cavinti and Lumban before surrendering in Pagsanjan a year later.

In 1670, a delimitation of borders were made between Lucban, Majayjay and Cavite..The most populous town at that time, Bay, was capital of the province until 1688, when the seat of the provincial government was moved to Pagsanján..Pagsanján would be the provincial seat until 1858 when it was moved once again to Santa Cruz..In 1754, the province of Laguna and Tayabas were divided, with the Malinao River separating the towns of Majayjay and Lucban.
In 1678, Fray Hernando Cabrera founded San Pablo de los Montes (now San Pablo City) and built a wooden church and convent considered as the best and finest in the province.
Fighting extended to Laguna during the British occupation of Manila between the years of 1762–64..A detachment of British troops under Captain Thomas Backhouse entered the province in search of the silver cargo of the galleon Filipina while Francisco de San Juan led a band of volunteers that fought them in several engagements in and around the then provincial capital of Pagsanjan..Backhouse plundered the town and burned its newly reconstructed church but San Juan succeeded in escaping with the precious hoard to Pampanga where the treasure greatly bolstered the defense effort of Governor-General Simón de Anda y Salazar..For his actions, San Juan was made a brigade commander and alcalde mayor of Tayabas (now Quezon) province.
In 1774, authorities from Bulacan, Tondo, Laguna Bay, and other areas surrounding Manila reported with consternation that discharged soldiers and deserters (from Mexico, Spain and Peru) were providing Indios military training for the weapons that had been disseminated all over the territory during the British war.
By the end of the 1700s, Laguna was a major province of 14,392 native families and 336 Spanish Filipino families.
A major event in Laguna occurred in 1840, when religious intolerance led the people of Majayjay, Nagcarlan, Bay, and Biñan to join the revolt of Hermano Pule (Apolinario de la Cruz) of Lucban, Tayabas..This revolt was eventually crushed by Governor-General Marcelino de Oraá Lecumberri.
As part of political restructuring during the 19th century, the municipalities of Morong, Pililla, Tanay, Baras, Binangonan, Jalajala, Angono and Cardona were separated from Laguna and re-organized to the province Politico-Militar Distrito de Morong..In 1858, the provincial capital was once again moved from Pagsanjan to Santa Cruz, where it stands until today.
In 1861, José Rizal was born in Calamba to Francisco Mercado and Teodora Alonso..Rizal would become one of the leading members of the Propaganda Movement, who advocated political reforms for the colony..Rizal would go on to write two novels, Noli Me Tángere and El filibusterismo, which in part fueled additional anti-colonial sentiment, contributing to the eventual Philippine Revolution..In 1896, thousands of inhabitants, especially of Bay, Los Baños, Nagcarlan, Magdalena, Santa Cruz, and Pagsanjan had joined the revolutionary Katipunan..Rizal was executed on December 30, 1896, on charges of rebellion..Today, Rizal is recognized as a national hero of the Philippines.
Historical marker of the Battle of Sambat, Pagsanjan, Laguna
Laguna was one of the eight provinces to rise in revolt against the Spanish misrule led by Generals Paciano Rizal in Calamba, Severino Taiño in Pagsanjan, Agueda Kahabagan in Calauan, and Miguel Malvar in Batangas.
The defeat in Sambat meant the end of large-scale organized revolt in Laguna, the Malungingnging chapter of the Katipunan failing to replicate the relative success of the revolution in Cavite..The revolutionaries resorted to hit-and-run and guerrilla tactics against the Spanish, lasting until the Pact of Biak-na-Bato on December 14 to 15, 1897..It was only after the execution of José Rizal that the revolution flared up again, culminating in the Battle of Calamba in May 1898, and the surrender of the last Spanish garrison in Laguna in Santa Cruz, on August 31 of the same year.
Laguna actively supported the First Philippine Republic proclaimed at Malolos on January 23, 1899..Its two delegates to the Malolos Congress were Don Higino Benítez and Don Graciano Cordero, both natives of Pagsanján.
Philippine–American War
Upon the outbreak of the Philippine–American War, Generals Juan Cailles and Paciano Rizal led the defense of Laguna during the war's early stages..The Battle of Mabitac was fought in defense of the town of Mabitac and was won by Filipino forces..However, forces led by Henry W. Lawton fought and won in Santa Cruz, Pagsanjan, and Paete, effectively securing the province for American forces..Resistance still occurred during this time..One of the province's folk hero during the continuing engagements was Teodoro Asedillo, who was considered a bandit by American forces.
American invasion era
By the end of the war, the entire country was occupied by American forces and was taken as a colony..The Taft Commission was established to govern the Philippines during the interim period, which appointed Juan Cailles as the provincial governor of Laguna..Act No..83, or the Provincial Government Act, established a civilian government under American occupation..During this time, roads were built, schools were established, and in 1917, the Manila Railroad Company extended its line to Laguna as far as Pagsanjan.
In 1903, the town of Muntinlupa became part of La Laguna and was annexed to the town of Biñan,
Japanese occupation era
During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines (1942–1945), Laguna was a center of Filipino resistance despite the presence of Makapili collaborators.
Marking's Guerrillas raided the Cine Lumban in Laguna in June 1942 in an attempt to free the 115 American POWs..Only one American was rescued, Corporal George Lightman of the 3rd Pursuit Squadron, because the ranking American captain ordered his men to stay where they were..The Japanese executed 10 American prisoners in retribution.
The establishment of the military general headquarters and military camp bases of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the Philippine Constabulary is a military unit organization was founded on January 3, 1942, to June 30, 1946, in the province of Laguna, and aided of the local military regular units of the Philippine Commonwealth Army 4th and 42nd Infantry Division and the Philippine Constabulary 4th Constabulary Regiment..Started the engagements of the Anti-Japanese Military Operations in Southern Luzon, Mindoro and Palawan from 1942 to 1945 against the Japanese Imperial forces.
Beginning in 1945, attacks by the Filipino soldiers of the 4th, 42nd, 43rd, 45th, 46th and 47th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, 4th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary and the recognized guerrillas against Japanese forces in Laguna increased in anticipation of the Liberation of the Philippines by joint Filipino & American forces.
Philippine independence
The International Rice Research Institute was established in 1960, during the presidency of Carlos P. Garcia, and a site in Los Baños was selected to be its headquarters..By 1962 during the presidency of Diosdado Macapagal, IRRI had begun research to develop the new high yield ""Miracle Rice"" (IR8) variety.
The social unrest which arose when Ferdinand Marcos' debt-driven campaign spending led to the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis
Laguna has been the victim of perennial flooding along the south and eastern coasts of Laguna de Bay due to the 1977 cancellation of the Parañaque spillway project..The spillway had been the second part of a plan to reduce flooding on the lakeshore towns of Metro Manila in the 1970s, but the various economic crises of the 1970s led to a lack of budget, which meant that only the Manggahan Floodway in Rizal province was built.

Lanao province map in 1918
The province of Lanao existed from 1914 until 1959..In 1959, Republic Act No..222 was passed by the Philippine Congress, partitioning Lanao into two provinces: Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur.
The province then consisted of the municipalities of Baloi, Kauswagan, Bacolod, Maigo, Kolambugan, Tubod, Baroy, Lala, Kapatagan, Karomatan and the following municipal districts that got converted into regular municipalities of Matungao, Pantao Ragat, Munai, Tangcal, and Nunungan.
In 1977, President Ferdinand E. Marcos signed Resolution No..805, s. 1977 of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan (Parliamentary Bill No..586) sponsored by Assemblyman Abdullah D. Dimaporo, into Presidential Decree 181 transferring the province's capital from Iligan City to the municipality of Tubod.
In October 1984, inaugural ceremonies were held to celebrate the occasion of the transfer of the Provincial Capitol from Poblacion, Tubod to the Don Mariano Marcos Government Center (now Governor Arsenio A. Quibranza Provincial Government Center) at Pigcarangan, in Tubod.
Despite the outbreak of the conflict of the MILF led by Abdullah Commander Bravo Goldiano Macapaar bin Sabbar and the Philippine Army in Kauswagan in March 2000, through the provincial government's effort, peace and order was restored in the province.
In 2018, the Bangsamoro Organic Law was passed into law; this law provided for the establishment of a new Bangsamoro autonomous region to replace the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao..According to this law, the six municipalities of Munai, Tagoloan, Pantar, Baloi, Tangcal, and Nunungan would be incorporated into this new region should a majority of voters in both the affected municipality and the parent province vote in favor of inclusion of the aforementioned municipalities in the proposed autonomous region in a plebiscite..The plebiscite was held the following year.

Lanao del Sur (Tagalog: Timog Lanao; Meranaw and Iranun: Pagabagatan Ranao), officially the Province of Lanao del Sur, is a province in the Philippines located in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM)..The capital is the city of Marawi, and it borders Lanao del Norte to the north, Bukidnon to the east, and Maguindanao del Norte and Cotabato to the south..To the southwest lies Illana Bay, an arm of the Moro Gulf.
Situated in the interior of Lanao del Sur is Lanao Lake, the largest in Mindanao.
Etymology
""Lanao"" means ""lake"", derived from ranao..The province, situated at basin of Lake Lanao, is known as the land of the ""Maranaos"" (which means ""the ""people of the lake"").
History
Further information: Lanao (province)
Early history
Prior to the arrival of Islam, the region already had a sophisticated culture, as embodied in various Maranao epics, chants, and recorded history..The people of Lanao used to adhere to Hinduism, polytheist animism, and Buddhism..During this era, various cultural icons developed, such as the torogan, the singkil dance, the darangen epic, the unique Maranao gong and metal craft culture, the sarimanok, the okir motif, and an indigenous suyat script.
Spanish colonization era
Main article: Confederate States of Lanao
Lanao was first explored by the Spaniards in 1689, upon which they discovered a well-settled community named Dansalan at the lake's northern end..Lanao was the seat of the Sultanate of Lanao.
During the Pre-Spanish time, there were 4 important boundaries which held the power of appointing a new sultan namely: Bakayawan, Dalama, Madamba and Sawer..In appointing a new sultan the permission of these four boundaries are needed to validate the new sultan appointed to his position.
Japanese occupation era
In 1942, it was occupied by the Japanese Imperial Forces who landed in Southern Lanao..On May 2, 1942, the former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines José Abad Santos was killed by the Japanese Imperial forces in a firing squad at Malabang, Lanao del Sur..In 1945, the first of the liberation forces landed in Southern Lanao and liberated the area with United States, Philippine Commonwealth troops together with the Maranao guerrilla units..They used infantry weapons, the Maranao Kris, Barong and Kampilan swords against the Japanese forces in the Battle of Lanao.
Philippine independence
In 1956, Republic Act No..1552 changed the name Dansalan to Marawi, taken from the word rawi, referring to the reclining lilies abundant in the Agus River.

Division
In 1959, Lanao was divided into two provinces, Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur, under Republic Act No..2228..Marawi was designated as the capital of Lanao del Sur.
Proposed Maranaw province
In 1971, Republic Act No..6406, which sought to create a new province out of eastern Lanao del Sur (now corresponding to the province's first congressional district), was approved on October 4, 1971..The province was to consist of the municipalities of Bubong, Ditsaan-Ramain (including what is now Buadiposo-Buntong), Kapai, Lumba-Bayabao (including what is now Maguing), Marantao, Masiu, Mulondo, Saguiaran, Piagapo, Poona Bayabao, Tamparan, Taraka and Wao (including what is now Bumbaran), with the chartered city of Marawi serving as the new provincial capital..The division never took place due to the declaration of Martial law in the Philippines on September 21, 1972, which disrupted the elections for 1973.
Inclusion to the ARMM
In a 1989 plebiscite, Lanao del Sur voted to join the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), but the city of Marawi voted to remain outside the ARMM..It later joined ARMM in 2001 following the plebiscite that sought to expand the autonomous region.
Contemporary
The Battle of Marawi began and ended in 2017..The battle was against ISIL-affiliated militants, a number of which were Malaysian citizens..The battle destroyed most of the cityscape of Marawi and killed hundreds of civilians and Filipino soldiers.
A petition was released in support for the usage of the torogan as inspiration for the rehabilation of Marawi after the Battle of Marawi..The petition was released in opposition to the possible Manila Rehabilation Effect that the government plans to impose..The Manila-style rehabilation would establish shanty shouses and buildings without Maranao architectural styles, thus destroying Marawi's Maranao cultural skyline..The petition advocates a Warsaw-style Rehabilation Effect, where the culture and styles of a particular area is used as foundation for rehabilitation of built heritage and landscape..Among the local architectural styles that may be used under the Warsaw-style are the okir, sarimanok, and inspirations from the torogan..The Warsaw-style is also foreseen to boost tourism in the city in the long-run due to the cultural aesthetics it would bring.

UNESCO Designations in Lanao del Sur
UNESCO has inscribed one Maranao element, the Darangen Chants of the Maranao People of Lake Lanao, in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2008..The element was earlier inscribed in the UNESCO Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity Representative List in 2005..The organization has also designated the Old Town of Tugaya as a UNESCO Home for Culture and Heritage..UNESCO has recommended for the nomination of Tugaya and all of Lanao del Sur's traditional crafts heritage in Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, following reports made in 2014 and 2015..The Philippine ambassador to UNESCO and France noted that it will be better to inscribe Maranao's traditional crafts in the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding as they have been endangered due to the 2017 Battle of Marawi..The nomination is being finalized by the Philippine government, as announced in 2018..The torogans of Lanao are also recommended by UNESCO to be nominated in the World Heritage List once proper documentation and restoration has been completed..Two torogans have been bought by a controversial heritage resort company, Las Casas Filipinas de Acuzar, and were transported to Bataan, sparking a provincial campaign to get back the two royal houses to their ancestral homeland.

Leyte (also Northern Leyte; Waray: Norte san/Amihanan nga Leyte; Cebuano: Amihanang Leyte; Tagalog: Hilagang Leyte), officially the Province of Leyte, is a province in the Philippines located in the Eastern Visayas region occupying the northern three-quarters of Leyte Island (with the remaining portion being the province of Southern Leyte)..Its capital and largest city is Tacloban, administered independently from the province..Leyte is thus north of Southern Leyte, south of Biliran, and west of Samar Island..To the west across the Camotes Sea is the province of Cebu.
The historical name of the Philippines, ""Las Islas Felipenas"", named by Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos in honor of Prince Philip of Spain, used to refer to the islands of Leyte and Samar only, until it was adopted to refer to the entire archipelago.
The island of Leyte is known as Tandaya during the 16th century.
Leyte is also known as the site of the largest naval battle in modern history, the Battle of Leyte Gulf, which took place during the Second World War.
Leyte is especially prone to typhoons because it geographically faces toward the Pacific Ocean..On 8 November 2013, the province was severely affected by Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan)..The typhoon, known internationally as Haiyan, and domestically referred to as Yolanda, killed thousands of people and garnered significant international media attention..Leyte suffered similar destruction and loss of life in 1991 from Tropical Storm Thelma.
History
Leyte province in 1918, before its division into three provinces, namely Leyte, Southern Leyte and Biliran
Early history
The island of Leyte was once the location of Mairete, meaning land of Ete, a historic community which was ruled by Datu Ete centered in present-day municipality of Leyte and nearby towns..It was the oldest city-state in the entire Eastern Visayas region..Before being colonized by Spain, the island was once home to indigenous animist Warays to the East and other indigenous Hindu-Buddhist Visayan groups to the west.
Spanish colonial era
The Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos, first came to the island in 1543 and named it Las Islas Felipinas..When the Spanish government established government in Cebu, Leyte and Samar became part of the province of Cebu..In 1595, the religious Jesuits established mission in Carigara which preceded the mission established in Palo in 1596 and Ormoc and Alangalang missions in 1597..In 1735, Leyte and Samar were separated from Cebu to be established as a single provincial government with Carigara as the first provincial capital..Leyte had jurisdiction over Samar..In 1768, Leyte and Samar were split into two separate provinces.
American invasion era
On March 27, 1923, Act No 3117 was proposed to divide Leyte into Occidental Leyte and Oriental Leyte but was not proclaimed by the Governor-General of the Philippines.
On May 22, 1959, Republic Act No..2227 was passed into law that separated the third Congressional District of Leyte into a separate province of Southern Leyte.
Japanese occupation era
During the World War II era, the Leyte Provincial Capitol briefly became the seat of the Philippine Commonwealth Government.
Battle of Leyte Gulf
When Americans stormed ashore at Leyte, it fulfilled the promise to return made by Gen. Douglas MacArthur in the days following the fall of the Philippines to the Japanese in 1942.
Main article: Battle of Leyte Gulf
The Battle of Leyte Gulf took place in the seas surrounding this island from 23 October to 26 October 1944..It was the largest naval battle in modern history, when at least 212 Allied ships clashed with the remnants of the Imperial Japanese Navy, some 60 ships, including the super battleships Yamato and Musashi.
The First Battle of Leyte occurred on 20 October 1944..A successful Allied invasion of the island was the crucial element to the eventual Filipino and American victory in the Philippines.
Contemporary
The municipality of Baybay became a component city by virtue of Republic Act No..9389 which sought to convert the town into a city..The law was ratified on June 16, 2007..However, the cityhood status was lost twice in the years 2008 and 2010 after the LCP questioned the validity of the cityhood law..The cityhood status was reaffirmed after the court finalized its ruling on February 15, 2011 which declared the cityhood law constitutional.
Geography
Political map of Leyte
Leyte covers a total area of 6,313.33 square kilometres (2,437.59 sq mi) occupying the northern and central sections of Leyte in the Eastern Visayas region..The province is situated west of Samar Island, north of Southern Leyte, south of Biliran, and east of the Camotes Sea.
Administrative divisions
Leyte comprises 40 municipalities and three cities, all clustered into 6 congressional districts.
Ormoc is an independent component city, while the capital Tacloban was declared a highly urbanized city in 2008..Both cities govern themselves independently of the province and their residents do not vote for elective provincial officials.
Baybay attained cityhood in 2007 but reverted to its municipal status when the Supreme Court declared its city charter unconstitutional in 2008..It regained its city status following the reversal of the Supreme Court decision dated December 22, 2009..In August 2010, however, a resolution had been passed reverting 16 cities, one of which was Baybay, to municipal status..It was on February 15, 2011, that the Supreme Court reversed its decision once again, allowing Baybay, along with the other 16 cities, to retain their cityhood status.

The population of Leyte in the 2020 census was 1,776,847 people, with a density of 280 inhabitants per square kilometre or 730 inhabitants per square mile..When Tacloban is included for geographical purposes, the population comes to 1,966,768 people, with a density of 302/km2 (782/sq mi).
The people of Leyte province are subdivided into two closely related Visayan ethnolinguistic groups..In the northern, central and eastern parts are the Warays and in the western part are the Cebuanos.
Tacloban-Waray dialect is considered as the standard form of Waray language and is used as the de facto lingua franca in both Leyte and Samar Islands..Aside from Cebuano and Waray, most Leyteños can also speak and understand Filipino and English..Some students who have studied the Spanish language and a few descendants of Spanish colonists can also speak and understand Spanish.
Leyte is predominantly a Roman Catholic Christian province..The 2000 census stated that 97% of Leyte's population adhered to Roman Catholicism, one of the highest percentages in the Visayas..The remaining 3% were adherents of other different Christian denominations and sects, such as the indigenous Iglesia ni Cristo, the Kingdom of Jesus Christ and Members Church of God International, popularly known as Ang Dating Daan, and many other foreign religious groups like the Mormons, Born Again Christians, Baptists, Pentecostals, Seventh-Day Adventists (Sabadistas), and many more.
Islam is also present in the province and concentrated in the metropolitan Tacloban area..It comprises 0.3% of Tacloban City's population, and its adherents are mainly the Maranao people and other Moro migrants from Mindanao who work mostly as traders.

The economy of Leyte is a mixed agriculture, fishing, industrial, energy and mining..Rice is farmed in the lowland plains areas specifically those around Tacloban, while coconut farming, is the main cash crop in upland and mountainous areas..Sugarcane plantation is no..1 produce in Ormoc City..Since Leyte is an island province, fishing is a major source of livelihood among coastal residents.
The province is the site of the largest geothermal power plant in Asia, making it one of the resource-rich provinces of the Philippines..Excess energy of the numerous powerplants in the geothermal valley that generate electricity is supplied to the national grid that adds to the energy demand in Luzon and Mindanao..Mining industry has started to pick up in the province with the exploration in MacArthur..The iron smelting in Isabel has been operational for more than 20 years since its inception.
Leyte ICT Park
The Leyte Information Communications Technology (ICT) Park is one of the economic zones approved by the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA)..Located at Pawing, Palo, Leyte, the 6.8 facility hosts two business process outsourcing (BPO) companies, namely, the Expert Global Solutions (EGS) Company (formerly APAC Customer Services, Inc.) and ACUDATA, Inc. (a financial and data services BPO)..However, EGS decided to fully close its operations after its facility was destroyed by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013.
Leyte is emerging to be an ICT-BPO Hub for Eastern Visayas.
Transportation
Leyte is connected by air with its only commercial airport located in Tacloban City..Daniel Z. Romualdez Airport, which is one of the busiest airports in the Philippines, is served by three major airlines, Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific and AirAsia..Tacloban Airport primarily serves connecting flights from major Philippine cities (Manila and Cebu).

Foundation
See also: Maguindanao leadership crises
The idea of creating a province in the present territory of Maguindanao del Norte dates back to 2006 when the province of Shariff Kabunsuan briefly existed for two years before being reverted as part of Maguindanao.
Maguindanao del Norte was formed when Maguindanao province was split into two provinces; the other province being Maguindanao del Sur..The division occurred following a plebiscite on September 17, 2022 which ratified Republic Act 11550 wherein it proposed the partitioning of the province..Former Maguindanao Vice Governor Ainee Sinsuat was expected to become the acting governor of the newly formed Maguindanao del Norte province.
Sinsuat took oath as the first governor of the province on October 13, 2022 with former Maguindanao provincial board member Sharifudin Mastura as her vice governor..On April 28, 2023, President Bongbong Marcos appointed Abdulraof Macacua as the full pledged governor of the province while Sinsuat was appointed as the vice governor..On August 14, 2023, Sinsuat vacated her position as vice governor and revived her claim as the legitimate governor..Both the national and Bangsamoro regional government does not recognize Sinsuat's claim.

Marinduque (/ˌmærənˈduːkeɪ/; Tagalog pronunciation: ), officially the Province of Marinduque, is an island province in the Philippines located in Southwestern Tagalog Region or Mimaropa, formerly designated as Region IV-B..Its capital is the municipality of Boac..Marinduque lies between Tayabas Bay to the north and Sibuyan Sea to the south..It is west of the Bondoc Peninsula of Quezon province in mainland Luzon; east of Mindoro Island; and north of the island province of Romblon..Some parts of the Verde Island Passage, the center of the center of world's marine biodiversity and a protected marine area, are also within Marinduque's provincial waters.
The province of Marinduque was ranked number 1 by the Philippine National Police and Philippine Security Forces as the 2013 Most Peaceful Province of the country due to its low crime rate statistics alternately ranking with the province of Batanes yearly..Furthermore, for almost 200 years, the province is home to one of the oldest religious festivals of the country, the Moriones celebrated annually every Holy Week.
Etymology
The most accepted theory of the etymology of the province's name is a Hispanized corruption of either malindig or malindug, which means ""stand tall"" or ""elegant"", in reference to a potentially active volcano in the southern section of the island, the Mount Malindig.
In 1676, Domingo Navarette wrote in Tratados historicos..., ""The island which the people from there call Minolo is named Mindoro by the Spaniards, and that of Malindic we call Marinduque."".(trans..by E.H. Blaire and J.A..Robertson)
History
Middle ages
The island was called Malindig in Tagalog and Malindog in Visayan languages..It was likely a constituent of the Kingdom of Luzon, due to the immediate Spanish claims to the island after the fall of Manila in May 1570.
It is possible that there were nobility who ruled Malindig since there are principalia or princely figures in Marinduque during Spanish rule.
Spanish rule
From the Visayan name Malindog, Marinduque became the name of the island in Castilian.
In 1571, Governor-General Miguel López de Legaspi had entrusted (encomienda) Marinduque to Fr..Pedro de Herrera, the first Augustinian priest who introduced Christianity to Marinduqueños.
Marinduque was part of the province of Balayan (now Batangas) in the 16th century, and of Mindoro from the 17th to 19th century.
Antoine-Alfred Marche, a French naturalist, carried out an archaeological investigation in Marinduque from April to July 1881..An abundant yield of urns, vases, gold ornaments, skulls, and other ornaments were found..He brought these to France in 40 crates..Part of it is said to be housed at the Musée de l'Homme (""museum of man"") in France..The finds also included an image of wooden polytheistic religious statues (anito) which at the time were already called pastores by Marinduqueños.
One of the artifacts found by Marche also found its way to the National Museum of Natural History of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. (Catalogue No..A127996-0, Department of Anthropology, NMNH, Smithsonian Institution)..Fragile jarlets that were found were said to have travelled from China to Marinduque..Buried in a cave for centuries and excavated in the late 19th century, these were brought to Paris and one was then brought at the Smithsonian Institution museum.
First Philippine Republic
Marinduque, governed through the province of Mindoro, was a constituent of the first Philippine Republic from January 1899 to April 1901 under Pres..Emilio Aguinaldo.
During the Philippine–American War, Marinduque was the first province where American invaders established concentration camps..In the Battle of Pulang Lupa, under the direction of Colonel Maximo Abad, 250 Filipino soldiers defeated 54 American infantrymen.
American rule
Col. Abad after capturing the Americans later surrendered on 15 April 1901, upon orders from Pres..Aguinaldo and due to the capture of Gov..Martin Lardizabal and two other officials who were held hostage by the Americans at Fort Santiago..: 535
On 23 June 1902, by virtue of Act No..423, the US-Philippine Commission annexed the islands of Mindoro (now two separate provinces) and Lubang (now part of Occidental Mindoro) to the province..Four months later, on the 10th of November, Marinduque was annexed to the province of Tayabas (now Quezon) by virtue of an Act No..499.
On 21 February 1920, Act No..2280 was passed by the Philippine Congress, reestablishing Marinduque as a separate province.
According to Henry Otley Beyer, an American anthropologist, while many other accidental discoveries and finds have been recorded from time to time and European and Filipino scientists had casually explored a few burial caves and sites, no systematic work had been done anywhere else prior to these explorations..After Marche, the next important archaeological work was undertaken by Dr. Carl Gunthe in the Visayas Island Group in 1922.
Commonwealth of the Philippines
In November 1935, Marinduque became a province of the Commonwealth of the Philippines under Pres..Manuel Quezon..The Philippine Commonwealth Army was stationed in the province; the general headquarters was active from 1935 to 1942.
Japanese occupation
In 1942, during the Second World War, Japanese Imperial forces landed on Marinduque.
Second Philippine Republic
In October 1943, Marinduque became a province of the Second Philippine Republic under Pres..Jose Laurel..The sovereign, however, was the Japanese emperor.
In 1945, combined American and Filipino troops liberated the province from Japanese forces, returning the province to the Commonwealth of the Philippines under Pres..Sergio Osmeña..In addition to the return of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, the Philippine Constabulary was also stationed in the province..These were active from 1945 to 1946.
Third Philippine Republic to present
Archaeological findings that help inform Marinduque's history are exhibited at the Marinduque Museum in Poblacion at Boac and in foreign museums..The artifacts are to be analysed to aid the historiography of the island and the province.

The population of Marinduque in the 2020 census was 239,207 people, with a density of 250 inhabitants per square kilometre or 650 inhabitants per square mile, hence, it is the most densely populated province in the Mimaropa Region.
Religion
Marinduque is resided by various religious groups, with Catholics making up the greatest proportion with 70%..and the rest belongs to the different denominations such as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Iglesia ni Cristo, and various Mainline Protestant denominations which include Assemblies of God, Baptists, JIL, Methodists, Presbyterian, Seventh-day Adventist Church (SDA), and the non-denominational Evangelical churches also known as Born-Again Christians..Muslims, Anitists, animists, and atheists are also present in the province.
Language
The version of Tagalog spoken in Marinduque, known as the Marinduque Tagalog, has been described as ""the root from which modern national forms of speech have sprung,"" where remnants of archaic Tagalog could be found, spoken in a lilting manner by its inhabitants..If this linguistic theory is accurate, Marinduque's Tagalog has contributed significantly to the development of the official Philippine national language.
To this day, Marinduqueños speak an old variation of the Tagalog language that is very close to the way Tagalog was spoken before the Spanish colonization..According to language experts  Many educated Marinduqueños speak version of Tagalog during Spanish colonial era and with English terms, closer to modern Filipino or standard Tagalog, because of mass media and modern versions of Tagalog Bible, and retaining Visayan and Bikol influence.
Linguist Rosa Soberano's 1980 The Dialects of Marinduque Tagalog goes into great depth concerning the dialects spoken there..The following is a verb chart which outlines the conjugation of the Eastern Marinduque dialect of Tagalog:

Linguist Christopher Sundita observed that some of the affixes in Marinduque Tagalog, particularly ""a-"" and ""ina-,"" are affixes used in Asi (Bantoanon), a Visaya language spoken in Romblon, just south of Marinduque..Marinduque Tagalog, like the Tagalog spoken over two centuries ago, had an additional verb category, the imperative, which was used for commands and requests (e.g., Matulog ka na - Go to sleep)..Even then, the imperative and the infinitive were used side by side in expressing commands; but in standard Tagalog, apparently the infinitive became used exclusively..And in the Eastern Marinduque dialect, the imperative affixes are very much alive.

Marinduque is an agricultural province, primarily growing rice and coconuts..Handicrafts from Marinduque are also exported to dıfferent parts of the world, and fishing is another important part of the economy..Mining was once an important player in the economy until a mining accident (the Marcopper Mining Disaster) occurred, bringing the industry to a standstill on the island and causing enormous damage to the inhabitants..The provincial government has just recently sued Marcopper's parent company, Placer Dome, for $100 million in damages..Placer Dome was purchased in 2006 by Barrick Gold, who has now been joined in the lawsuit.
A significant role in Marinduque's economy is also played by tourism, especially during the Lenten season..While this is not one of the larger parts of the island's economy, it has shown great growth..Recently, some residents are now engaged in butterfly farming..Butterflies are raised for export to countries in both Europe and the Americas..Locally, live butterflies are released in celebration on different occasions, such as birthdays, weddings, and some corporate events.
Culture
Festivals
The Moriones Festival is an annual festival, locally known as ""Moryonan"", celebrated in Marinduque from March to April..In Santa Cruz, Gasan, Boac, and Mogpog, a parade of people dressed as ""Moryons"" can be seen on the main road connecting the towns of the island..Boac and Santa Cruz, the biggest towns in the province, shows a reenactment in the evening of the actual event when Longinus, a blind soldier, punctures Jesus with his spear and blood droplets from the wound restores Longinus's sight.
Music
Marinduque is home to the kalutang, a musical instrument made of two pieces of wood that produce different note ranges depending on its size..A band of 10 to 12 can create music with this instrument.
Government
Marinduque has had its own Governor running a sub-government under Tayabas (now Quezon) in 1902 and as a provincial government after gaining its independence from Tayabas in 1920..The Governor is assisted by the Vice Governor, who presides over the Marinduque Provincial Board.

Masbate, officially the Province of Masbate (Masbateño: Probinsya san Masbate; Tagalog: Lalawigan ng Masbate), is an island province in the Philippines located near the midsection of the nation's archipelago..Its provincial capital is Masbate City..The province consists of three major islands: Masbate, Ticao and Burias.
Masbate is at the crossroads of two island groups: Visayas and Luzon..It is politically part of Bicol Region in the latter..However, from a bio-geographic and socio-ethno-linguistic perspective, Masbate is grouped in the former.
History
Early history
Masbate is one of the oldest settlements in the Philippines..Archaeological records show that Batungan (in Mandaon) and Bagumbayan (in Palanas) were major settlement sites during the Bronze Age (4000-1000 BC)..The development of bronze metallurgy in South-East Asia coincided with an increasingly hierarchical society, firmly based on agricultural village settlements..It was these crucial changes, the introduction of new technologies, new social forms, and a new economic base, which culminated in the foundation of the proto-urban settlements of the 1st millennium AD..A fine stone chisel from Mount Batungan is dated to the twelfth century BC..Of the age of Philippine neoliths, it is only possible to say that polished stone adzes from Masbate have been dated from 2710 BC to AD 179.2 Kalanay (in Aroroy) was an island site from 1000 BC to AD 850 (early metal)..Masbateño burial jars and a small pottery skull box found in caves dated to the beginning of the Christian era..Exquisite goldwork represents an old Philippine wealth in both an economic and an artistic sense: all sorts of wrought or molded ornaments and jewelry demonstrate both the availability of the raw material and the skill of the artisan – finger rings, earrings, head-bands, pendants, and pectoral ornaments, heavy chains with interlocking serrated edges, light filigree work, delicate necklaces of fine twisted wires, 12-millimeter beads composed of 184 separate granules soldered together, thin hammered sheets for decorating grosser objects like earplugs or the visages of corpses, and a charming little snail of unknown use..Productive mines in Benguet, Butuan, Masbate, and Paracale were in operation and gold being panned in riverbeds all over the archipelago when the Spaniards arrived.

During the Spanish regime, San Jacinto in Ticao Island was an anchorage point for the Manila-Acapulco-Manila galleons..The course as described by the standard pilot's guide of Cabrera Bueno was substantially followed by nearly all the galleons..The largest variations were in the height at which the eastward crossing was made and in the course laid off the coast of the Californias.
The successive stages were as follows: from Cavite on Manila Bay out through one of the bocas, generally between Mariveles and Corregidor; thence SSW, keeping well clear of Fortun to the left and high Ambil to the right; past Cape Santiago on the Luzon Coast, and E between Mindoro and Maricaban; by the Punta de Escarceo, or “Tide Rip Point,” where currents run strong, and under Isla Verde, outside Subaang Bay, within which there was a fair anchorage in case of need; SE past the islets of Baco, with a good channel off Calapan; SE by E down the Mindoro coast by Punta Gorda de Pola; E by SE between the Tres Reyes and the Dos Hermanas; thence by the wide bocanabetween Marinduque and Banton, out onto the tablazo, or open water, above Sibuyan; SE by E between Burias and Masbate; turning ENE around the Punta de San Miguel and the Punta del Diablo; coasting around the east side of Ticao to the anchorage at San Jacinto; clearing from thence and working out seaward with the monsoon; E right leagues, with the dangerous Naranjos to starboard and the shoal of Calantas to port; NE by N and then ENE seven leagues around Capul; NE with the Sorsogon coast to port and San Bernardino to starboard and NE by E seven leagues to the Embocadero, with San Bernardino now to port and the island of Biri to starboard..At this point, according to Cabrera, “the rapid currents require skillful pilot work.” The galleon was now in the open sea.
From the chronicles of the early years of Spanish colonization, a relacion (report) about Masbate first appeared in Fray Martin de Rada's letter dated July 1569 to the Viceroy of New Spain (Mexico), Marquis de Falces..He mentioned that in a place called Masbat there were plenty of gold mines..Other later documents such as Artieda's Relacion (1573) and Andres de Mirandaola's letter (1574) refer to a place called Masbat or Masbad..It wasn't until 1582 that Miguel de Loarca wrote about a place called Masbate.
In the same year that the Augustinian Fray de Rada wrote about Masbat's gold mines, his fellow Augustinian Fray Alonzo Jimenez landed in Burias and baptized its chieftain Buaya..This baptism is said to be the very first baptism in Luzon..Fray Jimenez also built a church in Burias before he sailed on to Ibalon in 1570..By 1575, Masbate had become a priority in the Augustinian Missionary Memoranda..Fray Francisco de Ortega reported on the pillaging activities of a pirate named Caxabic in the islands of Masbate and Burias..By 1600, the Spaniards had developed Mobo as a galleon shipyard and San Jacinto as a strategic port..In 1605, Masbate was officially an Augustinian Mission and it is first prior was Fray Francisco Guerrero..Masbate had about 250 tributes and 1000 Christian natives..In 1609, Fray Pedro de Arce, bishop-elect of Nueva Caceres, ceded the spiritual administration of Masbate to the Mitra (secular clergy)..On May 28, 1682, bishop-elect Dominican Fray Andres Gonzales petitioned the King of Spain to revert some curacies of Nueva Caceres to the charge of religious communities..The petition was approved in 1685 and by 1687, the first Augustinian Recollect missionaries had sailed for the port of San Jacinto to begin the Recollect Mission in Masbate..In 1700, Fray Ildefonso de la Concepcion established the settlement of Uson as a visita (barrio) of Mobo..The town of Masbate was established in 1791 by Fray Manuel dela Virgen del Tremedal.
The jurisdiction of Nueva Caceres embraced the entire provinces of Camarines and Albay, as far as and including the islands of Ticao, Masbate, Burias, and Catanduanes; the province of Tayabas, as far as and including Lucban; and in the opposite coast of Maobàn, to Binangonan, Polo, Baler, and Casiguran..At one time, it was governed by his very illustrious Lordship Doctor Don Ysidoro de Arevalo, who was the bishop-elect..Records show that he enjoyed a yearly stipend of 4,000 pesos of common gold, in conformance with a royal decree..Likewise, a payment was made from the royal treasury, in virtue of a decree by the supreme government and the council of the royal treasury dated October 2, 1723, 200 pesos, for priests of the choir, at 100 pesos each, as assistants of the aforesaid illustrious lord..Another payment was made of 400 pesos, assigned to this church by the royal decree, dated at San Yldefonso on August 19, 1736; for the pay of singers, sacristans, and doorkeepers, and other expenses for worship and for the  building of the church..It likewise had a contribution of 232 pesos, 4 tomins, which was paid in 6 quintals of wax, 100 gantas of coconut-oil, and 4 arrobas of Castilian wine, in conformity with another royal decree dated February 21, 1705.
The administration of Masbate was given back to the Mitra after the Recollects left Masbate in 1794..All in all, over 60 Recollect missionaries were assigned in Masbate for a period of more than 100 years..Masbate became a separate politico-military command province in 1846..In 1864, it was declared a separate province from Albay..After a devastating typhoon in 1908, Masbate was annexed to the province of Sorsogon..It finally gained status as a separate province on December 15, 1920, by virtue of Commonwealth Act No..2934..In Rafael Bernal's book: Mexico En Filipinas, Masbate was listed among other places which include Cavite and Pampanga, as areas where there were large concentrations of Mexican immigrants to the Philippines.
20th century
During World War II, the Japanese invaded the Philippines and turned Masbate into a hub for sexual slavery which they called ""the military club""..A ""comfort station"" was built by the Japanese in the province, where young girls and teenagers were forced to become ""comfort women"", and routinely gang-raped, brutalized, humiliated, and murdered by Japanese soldiers for entertainment.

Misamis Occidental (Cebuano: Kasadpang Misamis; Subanen: Sindepan Mis'samis; Maranao: Sedepan Misamis; Filipino: Kanlurang Misamis), officially the Province of Misamis Occidental, is a province located in the region of Northern Mindanao in the Philippines..Its capital is the city of Oroquieta..The province borders Zamboanga del Norte and Zamboanga del Sur to the west and is separated from Lanao del Norte by Panguil Bay to the south and Iligan Bay to the east..The province of Misamis was originally inhabited by Subanens who were an easy target by the sea pirates from Lanao.
The province is named after the early settlement of the Spaniards at the entrance to the Panguil Bay..The name Misamis is believed to have been derived from the Subanen word kuyamis which is a variety of coconut, the staple food of the early settlers..During the years the name persisted as an inference of the geographical location, and upon the advent of the Spanish settlers, the word kuyamis easily gave way to the more convenient pronounceable but corrupted word Misamis.
Etymology
The name Misamis is derived from Subanen word kuyamis which is a variety of coconut.
History
Spanish colonial era
The area of now Misamis Occidental was first occupied by Subanen which was followed by Maranao and later Visayans settled in the coastal areas..During the 1750s was the time that the coastal villages in southern Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao suffered attacks from bands of Muslim pirates, who burned houses and crops, and captured people to be sold as slaves in Maguindanao, Sulu, Borneo or the islands now known as Indonesia..In response, the colonial government in Manila created a flotilla and appointed a Spanish Jesuit missionary, José Ducos, as its commander.
After several successful battles against the pirates, when some peace had been restored, it was decided to build a stone fort at the mouth of Panguil Bay, at a place called Misamis, and Ducos was put in charge of the construction..The construction began in 1756..It was officially called “Fuerte de la Concepción y del Triunfo”.
Maps of Misamis, before its division into two provinces
in 1880
in 1899
in 1918
In 1818, Mindanao was organized into five politico-military districts, one of which was the Segundo Distrito de Misamis, the largest district in Mindanao..This area was composed of today's Misamis Oriental, Misamis Occidental, Camiguin, Bukidnon, Lanao, Zamboanga del Norte, and the northern part of Cotabato.
In 1850, the town of Misamis became the capital of the district of Misamis until February 27, 1872, when the Spanish Governor General Carlos María de la Torre y Navacerrada issued a decree declaring Cagayan the permanent capital of Segundo Distrito de Misamis..During this era, the name of the town was Cagayan de Misamis.
American invasion era
On November 2, 1929, Legislative Act No..3537 passed, dividing the old province of Misamis into Misamis Occidental and Misamis Oriental, which took effect on January 1, 1930..Misamis Occidental comprised the original nine towns of Baliangao, Lopez Jaena, Tudela, Clarin, Plaridel, Oroquieta, Aloran, Jimenez, and Misamis..Don José Ozámiz y Fortich became the first governor.
On January 6, 1930, the provincial council of Misamis Occidental selected Oroquieta to become the capital town (cabecera) of the province.
In 1935, the Provincial Capitol Building, commonly called Capitolio, begun and became the seat of executive and legislative power of the province, in the town of Oroquieta.
Japanese occupation era
On May 6, 1942, the Japanese Imperial forces landed in Misamis Occidental, beginning their brief occupation of the province during World War II..In 1945, combined American and Philippine Commonwealth forces liberated the province, and with the help of the recognized guerilla units, defeated the Japanese forces..During World War II, Misamis became the capital of the Free Philippines as the seat of government of the Free Philippines then was the Capitolio..The United States Forces in the Philippines under Colonel Wendell Fertig based in Misamis Occidental, was the rallying point for the guerrillas in Mindanao..This was historically significant because it is the only time in Philippine history when its capital was in Mindanao, in the region then known as Misamis..The Free Philippine Government was then issuing Misamis Occidental emergency notes..Late President Manuel L. Quezon, upon knowing that Oroquieta was made a capital of the Free Philippines and that the town was issuing emergency notes, authorized the printing of the Mindanao emergency note.
Philippine independence
On July 16, 1948 — the town of Misamis became a chartered city by virtue of Republic Act 321, making it the 4th city in Mindanao after Zamboanga, Davao and Marawi, also renamed Misamis to Ozamiz after World War II hero Ozámiz who hailed from the province of Misamis Occidental and who at one time also served as its governor and congressional representative of the Lone District of Misamis Occidental, senator of the Philippines, a delegate to the 1935 Constitutional Convention that resulted in the creation of the 1935 Constitution for the Philippine Commonwealth Government.
On August 24, 1981 - Members of a fanatical pseudo-religious paramilitary sect called the ""Rock Christ"" strafed the house of the Gumapons, a  family, in Barrio Lampasan, Tudela, Misamis Occidental..Ten of the twelve persons in the house, including an infant, were killed.
Contemporary
In May 2010 — the people of Misamis Occidental elected their first female governor, Herminia M. Ramiro.
Geography

Misamis Oriental (Cebuano: Sidlakang Misamis; Maranao: Sebangan Misamis; Tagalog: Silangang Misamis), officially the Province of Misamis Oriental, is a province located in the region of Northern Mindanao in the Philippines..Its capital, largest city and provincial center is the city of Cagayan de Oro, which is governed independently from the province.
History
Spanish colonial era
Misamis Oriental shared a history with Misamis Occidental of being part of the Province of Cebu during the Spanish colonial era..In 1818, Misamis was carved out from Cebu to become a separate province with Cagayan de Misamis (Cagayan de Oro) as its capital and was further subdivided into partidos or divisions: Partido de Cagayan (Division of Cagayan), Partido de Catarman (Division of Catarman), Partido de Dapitan (Division of Dapitan), and Partido de Misamis (Division of Misamis)..The new Misamis province was part of the districts of Mindanao during the later part of the 19th Century, with its territory spanning from Dapitan to the west, Gingoog to the East, and as far as Lanao and Cotabato to the south.
Misamis is one of the Spanish-controlled territories vulnerable to Moro raids..The Fuerza de la Concepcion y del Triunfo in Ozamiz was built as a Spanish military installation and one of the staging points in their expeditions against Moros..A fort in Balo-i in present-day Lanao del Norte was also constructed in 1891 on the orders of General Valeriano Weyler in its renewed campaign against the Maranaos..The Fuerza de San Miguel in Iligan was also built, serving as a muster point for Spanish forces in their campaigns in Lanao.
American invasion era
Misamis province
Main article: Misamis (province)
Misamis province map in 1918
With the organization of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu in 1917, Misamis lost a territory covering Iligan and coastal towns along Iligan and Panguil bays to become part of the Lanao province, making the remaining western and eastern territories of Misamis isolated from each other..Highland areas south of Cagayan de Misamis down to Malaybalay area were carved out to become a sub-province of Bukidnon in 1914, then eventually a full province in 1917..During this period migrants from Luzon and Visayas then flocked to the area to seek new and better life and various economic opportunities..Most of them are Bicolanos, Hiligaynons, Ilocanos, Kapampangans and Tagalogs in addition to Cebuanos.
Legislative Act..No..3537 approved on November 2, 1929, divided the province of Misamis into two due to the lack of geographic contiguity..It was not until a decade later, on November 28, 1939, that the division between Misamis Oriental and Misamis Occidental was implemented by Act..No..3777.
Japanese occupation era
In 1942, at the onset of World War II in the Philippines, Japanese soldiers landed in Misamis Oriental to occupy the region.
The American liberation forces landed in Cagayan in May 1945, with the support of the Filipino and American guerrillas based in Opol, Gingoog, and Tagoloan clearing the beachhead of Japanese defenders for the liberation forces to land.
Philippine independence
Subsequent creations of new local government units in the province occurred after the war..Opol and El Salvador were barangays of Cagayan, but due to their relative isolation from the Cagayan town proper, the residents petitioned for their separation to become municipalities in 1948..El Salvador became a municipality within the same year,
The island of Camiguin was part of the province, and in 1958 it was made into a sub-province..The island eventually separated from Misamis Oriental and achieved regular province status in 1966, with Mambajao as its new provincial capital.
During the Marcos dictatorship
Main articles: Marcos dictatorship, Human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship, and Ilaga
See also: Jabidah massacre and Moro conflict
The 21-year administration of Ferdinand Marcos, which included 14 years of one-man rule under Marcos, saw the rise of ethnic conflicts and the overall degradation of peace and order throughout Mindanao
Additionally, an economic crisis in late 1969 led to social unrest throughout the country, and violent crackdowns on protests led to the radicalization of many students,
During this time, Initao, Misamis Oriental was the site of the Holy Temple of Power of the Christian settler cult named Sagrado Corazon Senor (Sacred Heart of the Lord), which became better known as Tadtad (literally ""to chop"") because of their violent actions, and was one of numerous cults tapped by Marcos' military as force multipliers in their efforts against the Muslim secessionists and the communists.
In September 1972, Marcos was nearing the end of this last term allowed under the Philippines 1935 constitution when he placed the entirety of the Philippines under Martial Law, a period historically remembered for its human rights abuses,
Others were not as fortunate, such as labor leader Julieta Cupino-Armea, a key figure in the Labor sector resistance against the Marcos dictatorship in Mindanao whom records show was ""tortured, raped, beaten with wood all over her body"" for four hours by the Tadtad before she finally died..Cupino-Armea would later be recognized as one of the martyrs of the fight to restore Philippine democracy when her name was inscribed on the wall of remembrance of the Philippines' Bantayog ng mga Bayani (lit..""Monument of Heroes"") in Quezon city.
Contemporary
The municipality of El Salvador became a component city by virtue of Republic Act No..9435 which sought to convert the municipality into a city..The law was ratified on June 15, 2007..However, the cityhood status was lost twice in the years 2008 and 2010 after the LCP questioned the validity of the cityhood law..The cityhood status was reaffirmed after the court finalized its ruling on February 15, 2011 which declared the cityhood law constitutional.
In May 2014 it was reported that an area in Barangay Lapad in Laguindingan, Misamis Oriental, in northern Mindanao, was declared a heritage site..Oyster fossils older than 200,000 years were discovered, according to Balita Pilipinas..Property owner, Raul Ilogon, told Balita Pilipinas that they had been seeing the fossils for 20 years thinking that they were ordinary rocks.

The population of Misamis Oriental in the 2020 census was 956,900 people, with a density of 310 inhabitants per square kilometre or 800 inhabitants per square mile..When Cagayan de Oro is included for geographical purposes, the province's population is 1,564,459 people, with a density of 441/km2 (1,143/sq mi).
Ethnicities and languages
Although the native inhabitants of Misamis Oriental are Higaonons, Binukid and Manobo, the majority of the province's residents descended from earlier non-native Visayan Christian settlers from Cebu, Bohol, Negros Oriental, Siquijor and nearby Camiguin, accounting for 95.97% of the province's population..The rest of the residents are native Higaonons, Binukid, Manobos (who became minorities in their own homeland because of the non-native Visayan majority) and neighboring Subanens (native to neighboring provinces of Misamis Occidental, parts of Lanao del Norte and northern parts of Zamboanga Peninsula), as well as Maranaos, Maguindanaons, and Tausugs and other Christian settlers (and their native-born descendants) from Ilocandia, Cagayan Valley, Cordillera Administrative Region, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Mindoro, Marinduque and Bicolandia in Luzon, and Panay and Negros Occidental in Visayas who came during the late Spanish colonial period and since the American colonial and postwar eras..These non-native settlers are informally called Dumagats, from the root word ""dagat"" (literally means ""sea"" or ""ocean"") because they dwell among the province's coastline upon landing from Luzon and Visayas by boats or later by ships, causing indigenous Higaonons to relocate to the mountains to avoid contact with these newcomers.
Cebuano is the primary spoken language of Misamis Oriental, with the vast majority claiming it to be their mother tongue..There are also sizeable speakers of Bohol dialect of Cebuano in the province..A unique Cebuano dialect spoken in the municipality of Jasaan is called Jasaanon.

Mountain Province (Filipino: Lalawigang Bulubundukin) is a landlocked province of the Philippines in the Cordillera Administrative Region in Luzon..Its capital is Bontoc..Mountain Province was formerly referred to as Mountain in some foreign references..The name is usually shortened by locals to Mt..Province.
The province was named so for being in the Cordillera Central mountain range found in the upper realms of Luzon island.
Mountain Province was also the name of the historical province that included most of the current Cordillera provinces..This old province was established by the Philippine Commission in 1908,
The province is also known for its mummy caves, which contain naturally mummified bodies, and for its hanging coffins.
History
Spanish colonial era
The area of the Cordillera mountains proved difficult to control by the Spaniards..During the long Spanish rule, not much was done to bring the province under control..From 1566 to 1665, they sent expeditions to conquer the land but the rugged terrain and hostile indigenous population at the time were major obstacles to complete subjugation.
Formerly called La Montañosa by the Spanish colonizers due to its mountainous terrain,

Mountain province in 1918Bontoc sub-province in 1918, which roughly covers the territory of modern day Mountain province
On August 19, 1908, during the American rule, the Philippine Commission enacted Act No..1876, which organized the entire area of the Cordilleras into one large province, named Mountain Province.
The first governor was Samuel Kane, and the town of Bontoc was made the capital..It was originally composed of the sub-provinces of Amburayan, Apayao, Benguet, Lepanto-Bontoc, Ifugao and Kalinga.
Amburayan was later abolished in 1920 and its corresponding territories were transferred to the provinces of Ilocos Sur and La Union..Lepanto was also reduced in size and its towns were integrated into the sub-provinces of Bontoc and Benguet, and to the province of Ilocos Sur.

Philippine independence
Effective on April 7, 1967, Republic Act No..4695 abolished the old Mountain Province, converting its sub-provinces into 4 independent provinces: Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga-Apayao and Mountain Province (corresponding to the former Bontoc sub-province).
Mountain Province would have been significantly affected by the Chico River Dam Project during the Marcos administration, as the Marcos regime's project would have flooded the municipalities of Sabangan, Sagada, Sadanga, Bontoc, Bauko, and parts of Barlig.
On June 15, 1987, the Cordillera Administrative Region was established upon the issuance of Executive Order 220 by then-President Corazon Aquino, and Mountain Province was made one of its provinces.
Geography
Mountain Province covers a total area of 2,157.38 square kilometres (832.97 sq mi) occupying the central section of the Cordillera Administrative Region in Luzon..The province is bordered on the north by Kalinga, east by  Isabela, south by Ifugao, southwest by Benguet, west by Ilocos Sur, and northwest by Abra.
Situated within the Cordillera Central, Mountain Province is 83% mountainous while 17% make up hills and levels..The province has many rivers, waterfalls, mountains, and caves..The central and western areas of the province are characterized by rugged mountains and steep cliffs, while the eastern portion has generally sloping terrain.

History
See also: Negros Revolution and Negros famine
Spanish colonial era
Last page of the Acta de Capitulación (English: Surrender Document).
Negros was originally known to the natives as ""Buglas"", meaning ""cut off"" in old Hiligaynon..When the Spaniards arrived in April 1565, they named it ""Negros"" because of the dark-skinned natives they found..Two of the earliest native settlements were Binalbagan and Ilog which later became towns in 1572 and 1584, respectively..Other settlements were Hinigaran, Bago, Marayo (now Pontevedra), Mamalan (now Himamaylan) and Candaguit (now a sitio of San Enrique).
Ilog was made the first capital of the province in 1743..This was later transferred to Himamaylan..Bacolod finally became the capital in 1849..The island was divided into Negros Occidental and Negros Oriental in 1890..The two provinces were briefly unified as the independent Cantonal Republic of Negros, with Bacolod as the capital on November 27, 1898.
America invasion era
The  Cantonal Republic of Negros became a protectorate of the United States until 1901, when the republic was dissolved, with the two provinces annexed back to the Philippines..During the succeeding decades between 1901 and the 1930s, Negros Occidental and Negros Oriental were both under Insular Government of the United States of America as with the rest of the nation and later under the Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines..Economic growth continued especially with Philippine sugar having a part of the US market..The socio-economic lives of the island of Negros, from the 1950s up to the late 1980s, depended as before, mainly on the sugar industry.
From 1914 to 1927, parts of Western Negros hosted several newly established settlements which became cities connected by railroads constructed to flow towards several ""sugar centrals"" which were processing the extremely sweet raw sugar canes grown in Negros' volcanic soil and farmed by several ""Haciendas""..These haciendas littered the countryside as the central sugar mills eventually grew to become full pledged towns and cities: chief among which were Ilog, Hinigaran, La Carlota, Silay, Pulupandan, Bacolod, San Carlos and Bais
Western Negros also saw massive immigration from Panay as the Spanish, Chinese, and French mestizos who administered the Haciendas
Japanese occupation era
During World War II, both Negros provinces were invaded by Imperial Japanese forces, resorting many residents to flee to the inland mountains.
Hawaiian-Philippine Company Locomotive No..1 in year 1984 at the Hawaiian-Philippine Company, one of the oldest sugar centrals in the province which is still operational in the present..It is the only mill in the country still hauling sugarcane using a steam locomotive.
Philippine independence
The Negros Famine
Main article: Negros famine
By the time Ferdinand Marcos' second term began, sugar had become a critical Philippine export, responsible for 27% of the county's total dollar earnings..With international sugar prices rising rapidly through the early 1970s, Marcos decided to put domestic and international sugar trading under government control, first through the Philippine Exchange Co. (Philex), and later through the Philippine Sugar Commission (Philsucom) and its trading arm, the National Sugar Trading Corporation (NASUTRA), which were both controlled by Marcos crony Roberto Benedicto.
However, the international price of sugar eventually crashed.
Maricalum mining disaster
The Province has a history of problems with mine pollution, one of the worst episodes being the tailings dam failure and spill of 28 million tonnes of copper mine tailings from a mine of the Maricalum company on November 8, 1982
The Escalante Massacre
Main article: Escalante Massacre
During the 1970s and 1980s, atrocities against peasants were committed, with one such harrowing example being the Escalante Massacre.
Creation and abolition of Negros del Norte
Negros del Norte was created from Negros Occidental on January 3, 1986, but its creation was declared unconstitutional on July 11, 1986, and was immediately abolished on August 18, 1986.
Post EDSA Revolution
See also: Negros Island Region, Negros Island killings, and Sagay massacre
Towards the end of 1987, after the successful overthrow of the Marcos regime, the overall economic situation started to show a positive upturn..The campaign for agricultural diversification had been gaining momentum, paving the way for more landowners to invest in prawn and fish farming, seafood catching, raising of livestock and high-value organic produce such as fruits and vegetables, as well as other cash crops..Investments' upswing became apparent by 1988..The participation of the industrial sector accelerated the consumer-led economic growth and development manifested with the increase in sales of consumer goods and by-products..Today, Negros Occidental remains one of the most progressive and largely developed Philippine provinces, in large due to the profits from the sugar industry, but also due to economic diversification in other fields..Due to the vast population of Negros Occidental, it became the province with the most number of cities outside of the National Capital Region.
Contemporary
On May 29, 2015, the Negros Island Region was formed when Negros Occidental and its capital was separated from Western Visayas and transferred to the new region along with Negros Oriental, when President Benigno Aquino III signed Executive Order No..183, s. 2015.
Geography
Mount Kanlaon is the highest peak in Negros and the 3rd most-active volcano in the Philippines.
Negros Occidental is located in the western side of Negros Island, the fourth largest island in the Philippines, with a total land area of 7,802.54 square kilometres (3,012.58 sq mi)..The province is approximately 375 kilometres (233 mi) long from north to south..It is bounded by the Visayan Sea in the north, Panay Gulf on the west, Negros Oriental province and Tañon Strait on the east and Sulu Sea on the south..Negros is basically volcanic, making its soil ideal for agriculture..Eighty percent of all arable land in the island region is cultivated.
Lakawon Island
The north and western parts of the province are largely composed of plains and gentle slopes..A mountain range lines the eastern part of the province, forming the basis of the border with Negros Oriental..Kanlaon Volcano, which is partially located in Negros Oriental, rises to a height of 2,465 m (8,087 ft) and is the highest peak in the Visayas.
Administrative divisions
Negros Occidental comprises 19 municipalities and 13 cities (one highly-urbanized and twelve component), further subdivided into 662 barangays..It has the most chartered cities among all the provinces in the Philippines..Although Bacolod serves as the capital, it is governed independently from the province as a highly urbanized city.

The Paglaum Sports Complex is a provincial-owned sports venue adjacent to the Negros Occidental High School established during the 1970s that hosted various football events, such as the 1991 Philippines International Cup and the football event of the 2005 Southeast Asian Games..It also hosted three editions of the Palarong Pambansa (1971, 1974, 1979)..However, the stadium became unfit to host football matches following the erection of business establishments around the area..In 2012, a two-hectare portion of the four-hectare complex was partitioned for the construction of the Capitol-owned Negros First CyberCentre (NFCC) as an IT-BPO Outsourcing Hub..As of 2013, the provincial government has been proposing for a renovation of the stadium to serve as alternative venue to Panaad Park and Sports Complex, particularly for football competition..Recently, the Paglaum Sports Complex also serves as an alternative venue to the Bacolod Public Plaza for the MassKara Festival celebration.

History
See also: Negros Revolution
The Dumaguete Church in circa 1891 with its belfry to warn townsfolk of attacks by marauding pirates.
Early history
Negros, the largest island in the Visayas, is believed to have once been part of a larger landmass that was cut off by rising waters at the end of the last ice age.
Spanish colonial era
Spanish explorers on the expedition of Miguel Lopez de Legazpi first came to the island in April 1565..Legazpi dropped anchor in Bohol and sent his men to scout the island..Augustinian friars began the Christianization of the island the next year..The island was administered as part of the jurisdiction of Oton until 1734 when it became a military district, and Ilog became the capital of the island..The capital was transferred to Himamaylan in 1795..Negros became a politico-military province in 1865 and the capital was transferred to Bacolod.
Due to its proximity to Mindanao, the southeastern coasts of Negros were in constant threat from Moro marauders looking for slaves, so watchtowers were built to protect the Christian villages..The Moro raids and Negros Oriental's distance from the Negrense capital of Bacolod, induced 13 Recollectionist priests to petition for the division of the island in July 1876..The island of Negros was then divided into the provinces of Negros Oriental and Negros Occidental by a royal decree executed by Governor General Valeriano Weyler on January 1, 1890..Dumaguete was made the first and only capital of Negros Oriental..In 1892, Siquijor became a part of Negros Oriental, having previously been administered by Spain under the politico-military province of Bohol.
The Philippine Revolution reached Negros in 1898, disrupting government functions but without extreme violence and bloodshed..Revolutionary troops in the island were composed mostly of farm labourers and other prominent people of the province of Negros Oriental, who were organized and led by Don Diego de la Viña..The Spanish colonial government in Dumaguete and the rest of the island was overthrown on November 24, 1898..Later, the Negros Occidental area under the leadership of Gen. Araneta, along with the Negros Oriental area under the leadership of Don Diego de la Viña, merged to form the Cantonal Republic of Negros, a separate government from the more familiar Malolos Republic established in Luzon.
American Occupation era
In 1901, the Negros Oriental province was reorganized by the United States and a civil government was established with Demetrio Larena as governor..The American government made Siquijor a ""sub-province"" of Negros Oriental..Negros Oriental became a province under the American civil government on March 10, 1917, through Act 2711.
Japanese occupation era
During World War II, both Negros provinces were invaded by Imperial Japanese forces, resorting many residents to flee to the inland mountains.

Northern Samar (Waray: Amihanan Samar/Norte san Samar; Tagalog: Hilagang Samar), officially the Province of Northern Samar, is a province in the Philippines located in the Eastern Visayas region..Its capital is Catarman and is located at the northern portion of the island of Samar..Bordering the province to the south are the provinces of Samar and Eastern Samar..To the northwest, across the San Bernardino Strait is Sorsogon; to the east is the Philippine Sea of the Pacific Ocean and to the west is Samar Sea.
History
Spanish colonial era
Historian William Henry Scott wrote that a ""Samar datu by the name of Iberein was rowed out to a Spanish vessel anchored in his harbor in 1543 by oarsmen collared in gold; while wearing on his own person earrings and chains."".In the local epic called siday entitled Bingi of Lawan as written in the article of Scott, Lawan is a prosperous Lakanate in Samar particularly the northernmost part..Datu Hadi Iberein came from the Lakanate of Lawan
In 1614, the Jesuits established a mission residence in Palapag among the Ibabao populace..These missionaries stayed until the late 17th century when they were expelled from the Philippines in 1768 and were replaced by the Franciscans.
As the San Bernardino Strait was along the route of the Spanish galleons plying between Manila and Acapulco, Mexico, a royal port was established in Palapag where the richly laden Manila Galleons were protected from unfavorable winds and troubled seas.
In the early years of the 16th century, shipbuilders were drafted from Palapag to the Cavite shipyards for the construction of galleons and vessels for the conservation of defense of the island..It was also at this time that these recruits ignited the Sumoroy insurrection, which signaled a general uprising against Spain in the Visayas and Mindanao..The insurrection simultaneously flared northward to Albay and southward to the northern coasts of Mindanao and then Cebu..It took over a year before the Spaniards were able to subdue the rebellion.
American invasion era
Later in 1898, when the Americans landed on the beach of Catarman, they organized a revolutionary army led by General Vicente Lukban who fought the invaders armed with cannons and rifles with only bolos and paltiks..Although defeated, they, however, continued to harass the Americans through guerrilla warfare.
Japanese occupation era
During World War II, the people of Northern Samar organized a platoon of volunteers supported by voluntary contributions..The contingent became a part of the Philippine National Guard in Manila..The province also helped the government by purchasing a considerable amount of bonds floated to finance the National Commission for Independence, then organized by Manuel L. Quezon after a coalition of the Nacionalista and Democrata parties were formed.
Philippine independence
Congressmen Eladio T. Balite (1st Dist..Samar), Fernando R. Veloso (2nd Dist..Samar), and Felipe J. Abrigo (3rd Dist..Samar), authored Republic Act 4221 which was approved by Congress in 1963..The law, ratified in a plebiscite on June 19, 1965, divided Samar into three: Northern Samar, Eastern Samar and (Western) Samar..The first provincial officials of Northern Samar were elected on November 14, 1967, and on January 1, 1968, they officially assumed office.
Geography
Capul Island
Northern Samar covers a total area of 3,692.93 square kilometres (1,425.85 sq mi) occupying the northern section of Samar Island in the Eastern Visayas region..The province is bounded by north by the San Bernardino Strait, on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the west by the Samar Sea, on the southwest by Samar and on the southeast by Eastern Samar..It ranks thirty-seventh (37th) in size among the 80 provinces of the Philippines and accounts for practically 1.2 percent of the total land area of the country..About 52 percent of the total land area is covered by forest and 42 percent is classified as alienable and disposable.
The province is composed largely of low and extremely rugged hills and small lowland areas..It also has small and discontinuous areas along the coasts and its rivers are usually accompanied by alluvial plains and valleys..The province is endowed with relatively rich and fertile soil that most crops can grow on it.
Topography
Northern Samar has a very rugged terrain with restricted pocket plains and valleys..River valleys are low-lying and are often interrupted by hills, while the remaining portion is rolling, hilly, and mountainous..The interior of the mainland consists of highly dissected hills and mountain peaks..Low-lying hills are found between the coastal plains of Palapag, the river valley of Gamay, and Catubig Valley..There are lagoons and lakes (Cinco Forest), and falls near Catubig named Pinipisikan (citation tourism) too.
Climate
Northern Samar falls under the intermediate type climate, which has no distinct dry and wet seasons..The rainiest months are October to January, while the driest is the month of May.
Administrative divisions

Tourism
Northern Samar has several tourism potentials that remain undiscovered by tourists..Some of these include old churches, waterfalls, rivers, caves, virgin forests, and beaches.
Among the last frontiers in the country, its rugged coastline of limestone cliffs along the Pacific Ocean is a historical landmark..During the Spanish colonial era, Samar island was the first Philippine landfall seen by the Manila galleons as they approached the end of their long voyage from Acapulco.
Entering the waters of the Philippine archipelago, the galleons called at the fortified island of Capul off Samar, offered thanks for a safe crossing at the Jesuit church, and then negotiated the rough waters of the narrow San Bernardino Strait toward Manila, their final destination.
Capul also became the last stop on Philippine soil of the departing galleons before the long, often treacherous trans-Pacific voyage to Acapulco in Mexico.

Early history
These first settlers included tribes of Bugkalots or Italons, Abaca and Buquids.
When the waves of Tagalog migrations took place between 300 and 200 B.C., intrepid travelers and traders set up settlements along Luzon's western coast..These early settlements formed the nucleus of the Pampango Empire that was consolidated by Balagtas..The flatlands of the southern portion of Upper Pampanga was a hospitable place for these new Tagalog settlers..The indigenous tribes were forced to take to the hills in the face of the Tagalogs' superior technology.
Barter trade flourished among communities that settled along the great river..The constant riverside trading resulted in both a commercial and cultural exchange between the settlements in vast plains upstream of the Pampanga River..Settlements in Carranglan, Pantabangan, and Bongabon and prospered and grew into more stable communities.
Spanish colonial era
At the time, the Pampango crown has waned and had little resistance from Spanish invasion..When the Pampango Empire fell into the hands of Spanish forces under the command of Martin de Goiti in 1572, the conquistadores began their long upward trek towards Cagayan Valley and Mountain Province..Their forces passed through the settlement areas of the Upper Pampanga River..They also attacked the Caboloan of Pangasinan, effectively capturing more territories from local kingdoms.
Because of growing territorial domain and evangelical missions, a command outpost or Commandancia in the Upper Pampanga River area was established..Then Governor-General Fausto Cruzat y Góngora (July 25, 1690, to December 8, 1701) had most likely spent much of his time in the northern outpost in Carranglan and Pantabangan and, baking in the fiercely hot climate, probably waxed nostalgic about his hometown in Écija, Andalusia in Spain, which was also known as ""la sarten""  (the frying pan) because of its intensely hot summers..Thus the Governor-General hit upon the notion to name the outpost Nueva Ecija..Both the New and Old Ecija were washed by navigable rivers- the former, by Pampanga River and the latter, by the river Genil.
Conversion to Christianity
See also: Hinduism in the Philippines, Religion in pre-colonial Philippines, Indosphere, Indianisation, and List of India-related topics in the Philippines
Consistent with the history of Hispanization in the rest of Philippine archipelago, Nueva Ecija was established by Augustinian missionaries..The first mission was established in Gapan in 1595..The Augustinians abandoned their missionary work in 1636, maintaining only the mission in Bongabon.
At the turn of the 18th century, the missionaries resumed their evangelical work and redirected their efforts to the northeast, towards rough, mountainous terrain inhabited by the Bugkalots.
On September 1, 1759, King Carlos III of Spain issued a Royal Decree that ended the founding missions of Augustinians and transferred all Augustinian responsibilities in the settlements of Nueva Ecija to Franciscan friars..Through tribute collections and polo y servicio or rendering of force labor, the Franciscans constructed churches, convents, parochial schools and tribunals..They also constructed roads and bridges to connect other settlements..In 1781, a simple irrigation system was constructed in Pantabangan..This new farming technology contributed to the promotion of agriculture in the province.
New province
To make possible the establishments of settlements, military force became necessary to protect the friars and whatever basic settlement structures were beginning to emerge..Thus military outposts were of utmost importance, especially with the friars trying to convert fierce head-hunting tribes with spears and bladed weapons..It was around this time, during the term of Governor General Fausto Cruzat y Gongora (July 25, 1690, to December 8, 1702), that he established the military outpost he named Nueva Ecija..At this time, however, Nueva Ecija was still part of upper Pampanga.
In 1762, British occupation of Manila happened, and many Tagalog refugees from Manila & north areas of Cavite escaped to Bulacan and Nueva Ecija, where the original Kapampangan settlers welcomed them..Nueva Ecija, along with Bulacan, was natively Kapampangan when Spaniards arrived..Majority of Kapampangans sold their lands to the newly-arrived Tagalog settlers and others intermarried with and assimilated to the Tagalog, which made Nueva Ecija dominantly Tagalog, many of the Tagalog settlers arrived in Nueva Ecija directly from Bulacan.
In 2016, researchers of the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) and the provincial government found documents showing that in 1799, Carlos IV ordered the separation of towns and parishes of Upper Pampanga, near the Sierra Madre range, as well as coastal towns of Tayabas, along the Pacific Ocean and their organization into a corregimiento (political-military administrative unit)..Royal directives were implemented on April 25, 1801, and the corregimiento was named Nueva Ecija after the Spanish hometown of that period's Governor General Rafael Maria de Aguilar, with Baler as its capital.
Since then, the province had undergone numerous changes in territorial composition..The progressive towns of Gapan, San Isidro, San Antonio, Cabiao and Aliaga were all annexed to Nueva Ecija from Pampanga, resulting in an economic as well as population boom for inhabitants..While Nueva Ecija only had a population of 9,165 in 1845,
Other changes occurred in the following years until, in 1901, Nueva Ecija's northern municipalities of Balungao, Rosales, San Quintin and Umingan were annexed to Pangasinan..Nueva Ecija's shifting political boundaries in fact necessitated transferring its provincial capital four times..Still, these changes proved ultimately beneficial to Nueva Ecija, as they resulted in a territory with rich land resources nourished by an excellent river system composed of the Pampanga, Talavera and Penaranda rivers..This would help lay the foundation for Nueva Ecija's abundant agricultural economy starting with the American Occupation in the early 20th century.
Tobacco monopoly
Maintaining the Philippines as a colony became a challenge for the Spanish Empire..Expenses incurred in running the colony were usually paid for by a yearly subsidy (called real situado) sent from the Philippines' sister colony in Mexico..This financial support from the Spanish royal court was often insufficient, especially with expenditures in the Philippine colony growing each year.
This prompted the royal fiscal assigned in Manila to devise a plan to allow the colony itself to raise revenues on its own and thus be able to supplement the Spanish subsidy..This royal fiscal was Francisco Leandro de Vianna, who first proposed creating a tobacco monopoly..De Vianna reasoned, tobacco was a product widely consumed throughout the islands, with a market of roughly one million..He projected earnings of as much as P400,000 from the venture..The first time the proposal was made, however, both King Carlos III of Spain and colonial officials didn't give the idea much importance.
All that would change during the term of Governor-General Jose Basco y Vargas..Basco had plans to develop and promote Philippine agriculture, and de Vianna's proposal seemed attractive to him..After studying the proposal, Basco sent his plan to establish a large-scale tobacco production in the colony under complete ownership and management by the colonial government of Spain..What probably perked up the ears of the Spanish king about Basco's plan to make the Philippine colony financially self-sufficient, thus removing a huge financial burden from the Spanish crown..The King of Spain issued a royal decree on February 9, 1780, setting in motion Basco's plan.
Almost two years to the date of that royal decree, Basco ordered local officials and military commanders to prevent unnecessary losses of tobacco revenues..By March 2, 1782, tobacco production was established in Luzon, with La Union, Ilocos, Abra, Cagayan Valley and Nueva Ecija (still part of Pampanga at the time) as the centers for planting, growing, harvesting and processing tobacco.
This made a drastic and extreme change in the lives of all Novo Ecijanos..Where farmland used to bear rice, tobacco was now the only crop allowed to grow..These included the towns of Gapan, San Isidro, Jaen, Cabiao, Cabanatuan, Talavera, Santor and Bongabon..Each farming family was given a quota of tobacco plant to grow.
By 1850 the tobacco monopoly was producing immense financial gain for the colonial government..Some reports at the time pegged the earnings by as much as $500,000..One account in 1866 reported a much higher amount, as earnings rose to $38,418,939 that year.
Novo Ecijanos suffered a lot from the system..Nueva Ecija was more often able to meet production quotas compared to the other districts..Despite this, tobacco policy imposed a lower price on tobacco from areas closer to Manila..That meant that first-class tobacco leaf grown and harvested from Nueva Ecija was priced lower by one dollar, compared to those from Ilocos, La Union and Cagayan Valley.
The tobacco monopoly did not spur Novo Ecijanos to revolt, unlike the Ilocanos who staged an uprising over injustices in the system..Some tobacco growers in Nueva Ecija resorted to smuggling their own harvests in order to get some profit..But getting caught entailed harsher fines and penalties..Even sympathetic local officials had no choice but to enforce the unjust policies under pain of arrest and hard labor, once laxity on their part resulted in low production.
The flourishing tobacco industry coupled with the rich agricultural lands in central and northeastern Nueva Ecija also attracted migrants from neighboring Pampanga, Pangasinan, Ilocos and Tagalog areas..This made Nueva Ecija a melting pot of cultures and influences, the results of which are still evident in present-day Novo Ecijano culture.
As the tobacco monopoly fuelled further unrest, Spain finally abolished the monopoly on December 3, 1882..It was only then that they could all once again grow rice for food.
Philippine revolution
First prisoners of the Philippine Revolution in 1896
One distinct feature of the 1896 revolution against Spain in Nueva Ecija was that it was led by the elite, ruling class instead of the masses..Leaders of the revolt in Nueva Ecija were municipal officials and prominent citizens, who refused to collaborate with the Spanish authorities when armed struggle broke out..Despite being in the ruling class and enjoying positions in the colonial government, these prominent Novo Ecijanos proved their patriotism and love for fellow Filipinos.
In fact, one of the founding members of the reform movement La Liga Filipina
Once the Spanish authorities learned of the Katipunan's existence, those perceived as sympathizers of the movement, and even those who were falsely accused of being members of it, were arrested..Mamerto Natividad was among those arrested for sedition, tortured and killed by guardia civil..He was one of the first Novo Ecijano martyrs for freedom..His death, however, would result in bigger problems for the Spanish authorities.
Mamerto Natividad's two sons, Mamerto Jr. and Benito Natividad, later joined the Katipunan..The Spaniards burned their house and sugar mills in Jaen..Mamerto Jr. was later jailed for shooting a Spanish judge who had slapped his younger brother..As the Revolution gained ground, Mamerto Jr. was released and he was able to join the revolutionary army of General Emilio Aguinaldo in Cavite..By August 30, 1896, a state of war was declared by the Spanish colonial government in several Luzon provinces including Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Pampanga, Tarlac, Batangas, Laguna, Cavite and Manila.
Novo Ecijanos immediately proved themselves worthy of the fight for freedom..On September 2, 1896, Novo Ecijanos led by Gen. Mariano Llanera, capital municipal of Cabiao and Gen. Pantaleon Valmonte, capitan municipal of Gapan attacked San Isidro, the provincial capital..Their 3,000-strong army attacked San Isidro in distinct Novo Ecijano fashion: accompanied by music played by the Banda de Cabiao or Cabiao band.

Novo Ecijanos like Llanera, Valmonte, Mamerto Natividad, Jr. and Manuel Tinio conducted themselves heroically during the revolution..They were allied with Aguinaldo's Magdalo
Pact of Biak-na-Bato Filipino negotiators
On November 11, 1897, Natividad was killed in action in Cabiao, Nueva Ecija..His death precipitated the Pact of Biak-na-Bato, and Joaquin Natividad.
Later on, Novo Ecijanos would continue to participate in the drama of war, revolution and the fight for freedom..They would fight when the revolt against Spain continued after the peace treaty broke down and the United States, after declaring war on Spain, promised to help Filipinos fight for freedom..Then, Novo Ecijanos again joined General Emilio Aguinaldo in the Philippine–American War (after it became evident the United States wanted to make the Philippines their own colony).

The ""Cry of Nueva Ecija"" is the 1896 revolutionary battle led by General Mariano Llanera, manned and assisted by General Manuel Tinio and Pantaleon Valmonte of Gapan, Nueva Ecija and Colonel Alipio Tecson of Cabiao, Nueva Ecija who later on became Brigadaire General..The battle was fought in Cabiao, Nueva Ecija..Alipio Tecson would eventually become Gobernadorcillo of Cabiao, Nueva Ecija.
American invasion era
History records how the Philippine–American War began after American troops killed a Filipino soldier who was crossing the San Juan bridge on February 4, 1899.
When the war between Filipinos and Americans finally began, the fate of the infant Republic of the Philippines again lay in the hands of General Aguinaldo and his most trusted men who included Novo Ecijanos like General Llanera and General Tinio..And, as guerilla warfare became an effective tactic for the Filipinos, Novo Ecijanos were among the most feared guerillas..By the time the war ended on April 1, 1901, with Aguinaldo's surrender to the Americans, Novo Ecijano guerillas who had fought so fiercely and bravely against two sets of foreign invaders reluctantly gave up..Still that was not the end of the association between them and the Americans..The end of the Philippine–American War also signaled a new beginning for Nueva Ecija and its people.
The railway
Commercial, interprovincial trade was carried out using the Rio Grande de Pampanga as main waterway, with trade outposts in San Isidro and Talipapa..Traders from Bulacan, Tondo and Manila regularly came to Nueva Ecija to carry back rice, palay, tobacco, sugar, corn and livestock.
Americans, however, wanted to shift from water-borne trade to a land-based trade system..Their idea for establishing this depended on something they were masters at: building railways..The American colonial government thought a railway could help boost Nueva Ecija's economic growth, in the same way that the US railway system helped unite and develop the economy of the North American continent..What made the railway project attractive was that it was less expensive than building roads..At first run by a private company, the US colonial government took over the ownership and management of the railway system by 1917.
The Americans were soon proven right: trade conducted through the railways boosted Nueva Ecija's income by 25% while transport costs went down by 25% to as much as 75%..With the train able to transport more goods and more people at a cheaper rate, the railway helped spark a rice boom in Gapan, San Isidro, Cabanatuan, Santa Rosa and Penaranda..Farmers could devote more land to growing rice and even secondary crops like onions and watermelons.
More rice mills, farmers and farmer settlers came to Nueva Ecija..By 1936, there were 42 rice mills in Nueva Ecija, owned mostly by Chinese.
The agriculture-based economic boom brought about by the train's huge load capacity and greater speed (compared to boats) encouraged waves of migrations to Nueva Ecija from places like Ilocos, Pampanga, Pangasinan, Tarlac and Bulacan.
The railway brought other changes to Nueva Ecija..While trade was still being done by waterways, settlements by necessity had to be established close to the rivers, where people's basic necessities came from..When the trains became the main mode of transporting goods and people, and with the influx of migrants, it became not only possible but crucial to build more communities further inland..This meant roads and irrigation systems were needed.
Roads and irrigation
As communities expanded inward, first along the rivers and then along the railways, the need for roads and irrigation systems leading to communities in the plains became more urgent..These made it possible for the more remote towns—those farther away from both rivers and railroads—to grow crops and participate in trade, ending what was until then a very slow pace of economic development..By 1912 Governor Benito Natividad had appropriated funds to fast-track the building of roads and bridges linking these remote towns and municipalities to then provincial capital Cabanatuan.
The American government also constructed three major irrigation facilities: 1) The Talavera Irrigation System in 1924; 2) Penaranda River Irrigation System in 1930 and 3) Pampanga River Irrigation System in 1939.
By the time these irrigation systems went in full swing, combined with the railway system and the many rice mills, Nueva Ecija had been established as the ""Rice Granary of the Philippines""..From 1930 to 1939, rice production in Nueva Ecija was averaging more than 9 million cavans of rice.
Homesteading and US-style tenancy
Unlike the American pioneers of the Old West, Filipinos were not so willing to occupy remote, unsettled and undeveloped areas..So when the American colonial government introduced homesteading, there were few takers among Filipinos..Homesteading could be done through a legal process of acquiring a land title, or even without a title at all..In the latter case however, the lack of a title makes the informal homesteader vulnerable to any legal action attempting to take the land away from him.
When the Philippine Bill of 1902 was passed by the US Congress, the US colonial government was formally established in the Philippine islands..This meant the colonial government now had the authority to dispose of public lands on its own, without having to seek the approval of the President of the United States..Based on an earlier survey of public lands by the Philippine Commission, the new American colonial government offered public lands to settlers through homesteading, sale, purchase or lease.
Under the American regime's homesteading system, an individual could get up to 16 hectares of land, while a corporation could get as much as 1,024 hectares..This did not result in a wide settlement of lands throughout the country, however..Nueva Ecija was one exception, as more settlers opted to homestead its lands..A 1928 Statistical Bulletin records nearly 70,000 hectares were given to more than five thousand homestead applicants.
The homesteading efforts under the American regime ultimately failed in succeeding decades due to two major factors..First, the new farmer-settlers did not have enough capital to sustain farming costs..Without any financial assistance available from the government that granted them the land, farmer-settlers accumulated huge debts at very high interest rates from usurious moneylenders..Most of these homesteaders were later forced to sell their land and become tenant farmers instead.
Civil government in the American period
The civil governments established in various provinces in the Philippines under the American Occupation were supposed to teach Filipinos the basic principles of democracy, following US military rule..In general, each provincial government presided over local governments in each town or municipality..In turn, each municipality would have a president, vice-president and municipal councillors..These were elected by a select group of qualified electors for two-year terms.
The second Philippine Commission went to what was then Nueva's provincial capital, San Isidro, on June 8, 1901, to begin proceedings for establishing the local and provincial governments..16 out of Nueva Ecija's 19 towns were represented in the meeting..Elections of various representatives from the different towns were carried out successfully.
However, there was still the thorny problem of deciding whether or not to move the provincial capital..The dilemma was caused by events related to the Philippine–American War..First, Nueva Ecija had been a hotbed of resistance against the American Occupation, and was therefore in a state of siege..Four of its towns, Balungao, Rosales, San Quintin and Umingan, which were further away from the capital and already considered pacified by US forces, had been annexed to the province of Pangasinan..In 1902, the District of El Príncipe (composed only of Baler and Casiguran at that time, and now also composed of Dinalungan, Dingalan, Dipaculao, Maria Aurora, and San Luis) was separated from Nueva Ecija & annexed to Tayabas (now Quezon), which then became part of Aurora.
The newly elected Nueva Ecija representatives were of the view that since a civil government under the Americans was already being established, it was time to return the four towns to Nueva Ecija..This would benefit the province as the four town were rich in natural resources..The fact that the towns were quite far from the capital, one of the representatives suggested, was no obstacle: the provincial capital could simply be moved to Cabanatuan..Other representatives objected to this proposal, pointing out that Cabanatuan had no infrastructures wherein to house the provincial government..The matter was not resolved until two years later, when the US governor-general signed Act No..1748, ordering the transfer of the capital to Cabanatuan by 1912.
The civil provincial government of Nueva Ecija was formally established by the Taft Commission on June 11, 1901..The very first governor under this new system was Epifanio de los Santos..The main artery connecting most of Metro Manila, EDSA, is named for Governor de los Santos.
Education during the American period
Americans succeeded in making education widely available to Filipinos..While the Spanish government did, rather belatedly in their rule (in the middle of the 19th century), decide to establish public schools, it was the Americans who were able to improve it.
A report of the United States' Philippine Commission in 1900 showed, only 10 out of 23 municipalities in Nueva Ecija had a public school established during the Spanish times and according to the Philippine Commission figures by 1902, 37 public primary schools were established, and 63 Novo Ecijano teachers supported by 16 American ""Thomasites"", part of the larger group of some 500 pioneer American teachers who arrived aboard the USAT Thomas in September 1901, to help establish an American public school system in the Philippines..The Education Act No..74 approved by the Philippine Commission in 1901 proved to be the catalyst that made Novo Ecijanos rally behind the local and American teachers to make sure as many children as possible benefitted from the public school system.
People contributed in the form of cash, construction materials or labor, and even vacant lots for the building of schools..Community support for the building of schools was such that by 1906, there were already 99 schools in Nueva Ecija..The public school system was still hampered by problems..Relying only on local support, Nueva Ecija (and other places in the Philippines as well) could simply not meet the increasing needs of a growing number of schools, teachers and students..Given the high premium placed by Novo Ecijanos on education, a legislator from Nueva Ecija took the crucial step to compel the American colonial government to allot funding for public education via a legislative act.
Assemblyman Isauro Gabaldon of Nueva Ecija filed an education bill before the 1907 Philippine Assembly, which would later be approved and known as the Gabaldon Education Act..The bill required government to earmark P1,000,000 for public schools throughout the Philippine islands.
Nueva Ecija benefitted tremendously from the new education law..By 1908 Nueva Ecija had 144 primary schools, 11 non-sectarian private schools, 18 sectarian private schools, nine intermediate schools, one vocational school and one agricultural school, the Central Luzon Agricultural School, which is currently now operating as Central Luzon State University.
Japanese occupation era

When the Japanese tried to make the Philippines their own colony based on the book.
During World War II the Imperial Japanese Army entered the province and Nueva Ecija was taken in 1942..On March 29, 1942, under the leadership of Luis Taruc the Hukbalahap (Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon-People's Army Against the Japanese) was organized in Sitio Bawit, Barrio San Julian in the town of Cabiao..It was perceived to be the military arm of the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas (Communist Party of the Philippines), that brought about the beginning of the early organized resistance of the Filipino people.
During World War II under the Japanese occupation, The Philippine Commonwealth Army has the re-establishment of the Military General Headquarters, Military Bases and Camps here in the province of Nueva Ecija on January 3, 1942, to June 30, 1946, before the engagements of the Anti-Japanese Imperial Military Operations in Central Luzon include Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Tarlac, Zambales, Bulacan and Northern Tayabas (now Aurora) from 1942 to 1945 and aided the local recognized guerrillas and the Hukbalahap Communist guerrillas against the Japanese Imperial forces since the Japanese Counter-Insurgencies (1942-1944) and the Allied Liberation (1944-1945).
In January to August 1945, combined American and Filipino soldiers liberated Nueva Ecija with the recognized guerrillas continuing to harass the Japanese at every opportunity..When Filipino soldiers of the 2nd, 22nd, 23rd, 25th and 26th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the 2nd Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was re-invading launches to entering liberated the province of Nueva Ecija and helping recognized guerrilla resistance fighter units, the Hukbalahap Communist guerrillas and the American troops against the Japanese Imperial forces during the Invasion of Nueva Ecija.
On January 30, 1945, American Army Rangers, Alamo scouts and Filipino guerrillas conducted a raid to liberate Allied civilians and prisoners of war in Cabanatuan, this was successful with over 516 rescued..By January 31, 1945, the liberated civilians and POWs reached Talavera.
Post-independence era
After the war, much rebuilding was made at the urban areas of the province, specifically Cabanatuan and Gapan..This became the focus of the administrations of Quezon, Roxas, Quirino, Magsaysay, Garcia, and Macapagal..The city of Palayan was formally established by law and became the new capital of the province.
Marcos dictatorship era
Much of the rebuilding and establishment of economic centers in the province spiraled down due to the declaration of martial law by Marcos, which also resulted to the Talugtug massacre, where commonfolk Ilocanos were gathered and killed by the Marcos-controlled military, and the Gapan massacre, where the military killed-off a whole family, including children.
A number of Novo Ecijanos played an important role in resisting the excesses and abuses of the Marcos dictatorship, and were later honored by having their name inscribed on the Wall of Remembrance at the Philippines' Bantayog ng mga Bayani (lit..Monument of Heroes)..This included Catholic Priest Pepito Bernardo,
In 1986, Novo Ecijanos participated in the nationwide EDSA People Power Revolution, effectively ousting Marcos from power and restoring Philippine democracy.
Post-EDSA era
Repairing the severely-damaged economy was spearheaded by the Cory Aquino government, which also introduced a new Constitution and a game-changing economic reform policy, which resulted to the country's economic resiliency in the 21st century.
In 1987, Nueva Ecija's fourth district
Contemporary
The Estrada government was ousted due to illegal activities, leading to the installment of the Arroyo government..The Duterte government accession made wary ups and downs in the provincial economy.
Geography
The province is the largest in Central Luzon, covering a total area of 5,751.33 square kilometres (2,220.60 sq mi)..Its terrain begins with the southwestern marshes near the Pampanga border..It levels off and then gradually increases in elevation to rolling hills as it approaches the mountains of Sierra Madre in the east, and the Caraballo and Cordillera Central ranges in the north.
Nueva Ecija is bordered on the northeast by Nueva Vizcaya, east by Aurora, south by Bulacan, southwest by Pampanga, west by Tarlac, and northwest by Pangasinan..The province has four distinct districts..The first district (northwest) has a mixture of Ilokano, Pangasinense, and Tagalog, with little Kapampangan cultures..The second district (northeast) is the most complex as it has at least 10 different ethnic groups..The third district (central) has a metropolitan culture, coming from a majority of Tagalog culture, as Cabanatuan is within it..And the fourth district (southwest) has a mixture of Kapampangan and Tagalog cultures.
Flora and fauna
Rafflesia consueloae, smallest raflessia species in the world, is found only in the Pantabangan–Carranglan Watershed Forest Reserve.
The species of flora and fauna in the province is diverse on its north and east borders, which exhibit a shared ecosystem with the Caraballo mountains in the north and the Sierra Madre mountains in the east..The southeast areas are also known for its diverse fauna and flora due to the presence of the Minalungao National Park.
The orchid species Ceratocentron fesselii, which can only be found in the Pantabangan–Carranglan Watershed Forest Reserve in Carranglan, is considered one of the most critically endangered orchid species in the entire Southeast Asian region..It is endangered due to illegal gathering from the wild and due to the illegal black market trade..The forest reserve is also home to the endemic Rafflesia consueloae, which is the smallest rafflesia in the world and is found nowhere else..Philippine deer, Philippine warty pig, and other indigenous mouse species are also present in the province.
In a recent activity, the presence of a Philippine eagle couple was discovered in the Sierra Madre side of Nueva Ecija..The couple are now protected by the local government units in that area..Snakes, lizards, and various amphibian species are also present, especially in wetter months.
Administrative divisions

Nueva Vizcaya, officially the Province of Nueva Vizcaya  (Ilocano: Probinsia ti Nueva Vizcaya; Gaddang: Probinsia na Nueva Vizcaya; Pangasinan: Luyag/Probinsia na Nueva Vizcaya; Tagalog: Lalawigan ng Nueva Vizcaya ), is a landlocked province in the Philippines located in the Cagayan Valley region in Luzon..Its capital is Bayombong..It is bordered by Benguet to the west, Ifugao to the north, Isabela to the northeast, Quirino to the east, Aurora to the southeast, Nueva Ecija to the south, and Pangasinan to the southwest..Quirino province was created from Nueva Vizcaya in 1966.
Etymology
The name Nueva Vizcaya is derived from the name of the province of Biscay (called Vizcaya in Spanish, Bizkaia in Basque) during the Spanish colonial period..This can be seen in the right part of the seal, a representation of the heraldic of Vizcaya in Spain.
History
Spanish colonial era
An old map showing the province and its original borders.
The areas of present-day Nueva Vizcaya used to be part of the vast Provincia de Cagayan..Organized religion in Nueva Vizcaya dates back to the year 1607, when the Dominican Order arrived in the province..It was not until 1609, however, that the first settlement of a religious order was established in the southern half of the province..In 1702, a convent was erected in Burubur at the foot of the Caraballo Mountains in Santa Clara, which is now a barangay in the town of Aritao..It was on this site that the first mass in Nueva Vizcaya was celebrated and the first baptism of a Christian convert was held.
Spanish conquest of Nueva Vizcaya was slow and arduous..Expeditions had to be sent again and again because the natives refused to accept Spanish sovereignty..In some of these expeditions, services of some Filipino chieftains were utilized..The most famous of these expeditions was that commanded by Mariano Oscariz, in 1847–1848, which carried him clear through the province across to Palanan on the eastern coast of Luzon.
In 1818, Nueva Ecija annexed the towns of Palanan from Isabela, as well as Cagayan, Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino, Baler, Casiguran, Infanta (formerly called Binangonan de Lampon) and Polillo Islands from Tayabas, and part of Rizal.
In 1839, upon the advice of the alcalde mayor of Cagayan,
Civil government was established in the province by the Philippine Commission in 1902 during the American Colonial Period of the Philippines.
The territories of Nueva Vizcaya were greatly reduced when Nueva Vizcaya ceded a big portion of its north-eastern territory, including Camarag, its first capital, now Echague, to form the province of Isabela in May 1865.
American colonial era
In 1908, the northwestern territory of Nueva Vizcaya was annexed to the newly organized sub-province of Ifugao..In 1918, the area of modern Aurora north of Baler (composed of Dinalungan,  Dipaculao, & Maria Aurora, besides Casiguran & Dilasag) was transferred to the authority of Nueva Vizcaya, but returned to Quezon Province in 1946.
The province of Nueva Vizcaya was also included in the 12th district of the Philippine Senate during the American period..The district included Mountain Province (present-day Apayao, Kalinga, Mountain Province, and Benguet), Cotabato (undivided), Agusan (undivided), Davao (undivided), Zamboanga (undivided), and Sulu (undivided)..The province was included in the district because of its ethnic compatibility with Mountain Province and other indigenous domains in the Cordilleras and Mindanao.

Japanese occupation
Gateway Arch near Dalton Pass
During the Pacific War of the Second World War, the Japanese captured Nueva Vizcaya and established a ""comfort station"" in the province, where Filipino ""comfort women"" were enslaved, routinely gang-raped, and murdered under Japanese control..: 510, 535
Philippine Independence
In 1971, with the passage of Republic Act No..6394, Quirino, which was then a sub-province of Nueva Vizcaya, was separated from its mother province and made into a regular province.
Geography
Surrounded by North Luzon's three large mountain ranges, Nueva Vizcaya is generally mountainous, varying from steep mountains to rolling hills, with some valleys and plains..The province (and the entire Cagayan Valley) are separated from the Central Luzon plains by the Caraballo Mountains.
The province has a total land area of 3,975.67 square kilometres (1,535.01 sq mi)..The southernmost province in the Cagayan Valley region, Nueva Vizcaya lies approximately 268 kilometres (167 mi) north of Metro Manila and can be reached by land via the Cagayan Valley Road (Maharlika Highway).
Administrative divisions
Nueva Vizcaya comprises 15 municipalities, with Bayombong as the provincial capital and major educational center, Bambang (the agricultural hub) and Solano (the financial district) as the major commercial centers, and Kayapa as the summer capital and ""vegetable bowl"" of the province..All municipalities are encompassed by a lone legislative district, but are separated into two districts for purposes of representation in its provincial board..The 1st District comprises the municipalities of Ambaguio, Bagabag, Bayombong, Diadi, Quezon, Solano and Villaverde, while the 2nd District is composed of the municipalities of Alfonso Castañeda, Aritao, Bambang, Dupax del Norte, Dupax del Sur, Kayapa, Kasibu and Santa Fe.
Geographically, the western half of Nueva Vizcaya is part of the main Cordilleras, while its eastern half is part of the Caraballos, the meeting point of the Cordilleras and the Sierra Madre..There have been grassroot moves to reunify Nueva Vizcaya with the Cordillera Region due to cultural and geographical harmony, however, none have been introduced in Congress.

The population of Nueva Vizcaya in the 2020 census was 497,432 people, with a density of 130 inhabitants per square kilometre or 340 inhabitants per square mile.
Nueva Vizcaya is home to about 18 indigenous peoples, which includes the major tribes of the Ifugao (Quezon, Bagabag, Kasibu), Gaddang (Solano and Bayombong), Isinai (Dupax del Sur and Bambang), Dumagat (Aritao), Kalanguya (Santa Fe), and the Bugkalot (Alfonso Castañeda and Dupax del Norte)..Indigenous peoples' groups have filed for ancestral domain titles covering parts of the province.
The Ilokano population in the province are not indigenous as they were part of the labor force initially needed by the Spanish administration to work on the tobacco plantations beginning in the 1700s, and later immigrants with skills construct churches and other structures needed for development..Indigenous tribes were not cooperative with the Spaniards..After several insurrections by the locals, Spanish officials chose to import trained labor from established settlements in the coastal regions of Pangasinan and Ilocos..So, it was deliberated in the Spanish Congress the need for in migration of labor..After it was voted by a majority and approved by the king, Ilocanos started to migrate and were given homestead..Thus, the start of the migration of Ilocanos in the province.
Every last week of May, these ethnolinguistic groups gather to celebrate the Ammungan festival (formerly Panagyaman festival), a week-long affair culminating on May 24, the province's foundation day.
Since Nueva Vizcaya's birth as a province, traces of the culture and customs of its early settlers—the Igorots  The influx of civilization and the infusion of modern technology to the life stream of the province induced immigration from adjacent provinces..The province was pushed to be included in the Cordillera Autonomous Region because the province is technically within the Cordillera, however, it did not came to be due to the failure to enact an autonomous Cordillera by the national government..Today, questions linger on the exclusion of Nueva Vizcaya despite the province being culturally and geographically linked to the Cordilleras..The province also has the largest Igorot population outside the Cordillera region..Tagalogs live along the border of Nueva Ecija & in the capital, Bayombong.
Religion

The province is bordered on the east by the province of Oriental Mindoro, and on the south by the Mindoro Strait..The South China Sea is to the west of the province and Palawan is located to the southwest, across the Mindoro Strait..Batangas is to the north, separated by the Verde Island Passage, a protected marine area and the center of the world's marine biodiversity.
History
Early history
Mindoro Island was originally known to the ancients as Ma-i..It was formally called Mait, and known to the Chinese traders before the coming of the Spanish..Its existence was mentioned in the old Chinese chronicles in 775 A.D. and more elaborately in 1225..It was a major anchorage in the Southeast Asia trade route during the pre-Philippines period..Chinese, Arab and Indian merchants traded with the natives.
Spanish colonial era
In 1570, the Spanish began to explore the island and named it Mina de Oro (""mine of gold"") after finding some of the precious metal, though no major gold discoveries were ever made.
The natives of Mindoro were called Manguianes by the Spaniards..But the natives refer to themselves by their ethnic or clan identification..There were seven such ethnic or clan distinctions, which are differentiated by language and areas where each can be found.
The Mangyans, as they are now anthropologically known, do not have a warrior society..They are a peaceful, shy but friendly people..They are rarely known to be hostile, and have had no significant record of violent conflict with other people in the entire history of the province..They grow root crops in forest clearings (slash and burn farms), and hunt wild animals in the forest for their meat needs.
There are no authentic documents in existence explaining the original stock of the Mangyan people, but later theoreticians postulate that they migrated from Indonesia before 775 A.D..They hopped from island to island, until finally settling down permanently in Mindoro..It appeared that clan settlements existed in the North as well as in the southern ends of the island..By 779, the southwest coast of the island was already a known trading center, and its fine natural harbor frequented by Arab, Indian and Chinese maritime traders who plied the route..But there was no attempt of subjugation, just trading.
The first semblance of a political system in Mindoro's experience was provided by China in the 13th century..Chinese imperial forces under Admiral Cheng Ho with a powerful armada of 60 war junks visited Mindoro and other parts of the archipelago in the 13th century, with the purpose of gaining more trading favors for Chinese merchants.
For a time, Admiral Ho tried to exert some effort of rule as a prelude to Sino annexation..Internal trouble in the Chinese home front, however, recalled the armada, and the attempts of the empire to annex the archipelago did not materialize.
Some time after the Ho overture, Islamic influence reached the island, probably, - Orang Dampuans (economic refugees from Sulu) crossed Mindoro Strait from Paragua (now Palawan) and settled along the coastal areas, developing progressive maritime communities.
In 1572, Captain Juan de Salcedo of the Spanish expeditionary army set sail from Cebu and explored the west coast of the island, encountering the Mangyans, who appeared used to seeing foreigners and were not at all a bit surprised at their arrival..On the contrary, it was Salcedo and Martin de Goiti who were surprised to see cross designs on the clothing and basketwork of the natives, and thought some early Christian missionary had been there before them..But later scholars believed the design was Indic in origin and had no religious meaning.
The Spaniards also encountered Moro settlers in Lubang Island that were vassals of and paid tribute to the kingdom of Maynila in the North, under Rajah Sulayman..This was the first real political system in the island..The Moros, who apparently had heard of the invaders from their kinsmen in the south, engaged the small Spanish force who landed on their shore, but the Spaniards' arquebuses and cannon fire from the ships hoved-to broadside to the island took the field..The Moros fled to the hills, and Salcedo burned their village.
After the defeat of Sulaiman in the same year, Mindoro and other vassal states of Maynila became subject of Castillan rule..The island was officially referred to from then on as Mina de Oro (Mine of Gold), compressed later on into Mindoro..The free land name, Ma-i, fell into disuse..The Spanish-Moro war would rage on in Mindoro until toward the end of the Spanish regime in the 19th century.
In 1602, Moro forces plundered the most important Spanish towns along the coasts of Mindoro and Southern Luzon, and subsequently reestablished their hold in Mindoro by constructing a fort at Mamburao..From 1720 onwards, Moro raids became devastating not only to the island's Hispanized communities but to other parts of the archipelago as well.
In 1757, the Moros, more particularly, the Iranuns (a relative of the Maranaws of the Lake Lanao regions) organized a war fleet of 74 fast native ships called prahus..They destroyed several settlements in the island, carrying off their inhabitants to be sold as slaves in Jolo.
The fact that a Moro fort at Mamburao threatened Manila, the capital of the colonial government, embarrassed the conquerors in the eyes of their native subjects, which was politically intolerable to the Spanish administrators..So in 1766, the Spaniards gathered a large force of 1,200 marines, augmented by a large army of native mercenaries, and burned the Iranun fort..But the Moros simply faded into the hills to escape, and came back when the counter-raid was over and the raiders returned to Manila.
The Moros not only plundered goods, but also took prisoners of war which they sold as slaves..Many Islamic leaders in Mindanao, in spite of the peace settlement with the Spaniards contained in treaties and formal agreements, supported piratical raids with arms, ammunition and food, not only because it was a patriotic act (defending Moroland), but this patriotism was also giving them handsome profits..They received part of the ""prisoners of war"" when a successful raider returned, which earned them huge amounts.
Most of the raids were successful because of the fast watercraft in the employ of the raiders..It was not until the commission of the vapor, fast steamships, in the mid-18th century that the Spanish navy successfully patrolled the archipelagic waters, and fared well against the wind-powered native seacraft of the pirates..Many pirate fleets were sunk at sea, or confined to their hiding places.
The invention of machines during the Industrial Revolution, which gradually replaced manual labor, and the consecutive abolitions of slave ownership in many liberalized countries, caused a great decline in the demand for slave labor..Many of the pirate markets closed, and prices fell severely for captives.
With losses to the Spanish navy increasing, and the eventual fall in profits from slave selling, raiding became less appealing to the Iranuns and their Islamic supporters..Uneconomical patriotism simply did not make quite an appeal..Thus, it came to pass that the Moro pirates faded from Mindoro's history..The pirate fort in Mamburao was abandoned, and the Moros retreated to Mindanao to consolidate their forces and continue the Moslem resistance at the homefront..Mindoro Island then became a Spanish possession in a truer sense for the first time..But not for long.
In 1896, the Philippine Revolution begun, which spread throughout the islands..In 1897, the Spaniards posted a rifle company of 140 troops and 51 marines to Calapan to secure the island from the forces of General Emilio Aguinaldo and his revolutionary army, then beginning to overrun Spanish positions in the archipelago..Only Mindoro was relatively safe..In 1898, the revolutionaries attacked and overwhelmed the settlement that is now Bongabong..The revolution also ignited in the western part (Occidental Mindoro), which seized control of the settlements there from the Spaniards..Finally, they marched against the capital of Calapan with some 1,000 ill-armed foot soldiers.
The attack came to nothing..The Spanish defenses held..It was only the arrival of 1,000 regular army troops with artillery, all under the command of General Malvar in Batangas, that compelled the surrender of the Spaniards under Governor Morales..Hence on July 1, 1898, the Spanish rule in Mindoro Island, lasting for 328 years, ended.
American invasion era
A new battalion ""Mindoro"", with two rifle companies, was formed under the command of Captain Ruperto Hernandez and Estanislao Cayton, both from Batangas..The revolutionary political reins were held by the elite, who also held the same reins under the Spaniards (and later under the Americans)..The revolution, therefore, was for liberation against colonial rule but not a war for social change, which was to be defeated late in the US-Filipino war that followed.
In 1910, the successor United States politico-military administration granted over 50 square kilometres (19 sq mi) of land to the Welch and Fargo Sugar Company in what is now San Jose, which built the first modern and biggest sugar mill in the Far East at Siete Central (now barangay Central)..In the same year, the boldly developing community of sugar cane planters, mill workers, company professionals and businessmen enabled the creation of San Jose as an official Philippine town.
Philippine independence
In 1950, the province of Mindoro was divided into Oriental Mindoro and Occidental Mindoro by virtue of Republic Act No..505.
Contemporary history
In April 2023, the provincial government placed the entire province under a state of calamity due to the 20-hour daily power outage that has been occurring for a month and a half.
Geography
Apo Reef
Occidental Mindoro covers a total area of 5,865.71 square kilometres (2,264.76 sq mi) occupying the western section of the Mindoro island, and includes outlying islands in the northwest.
General land surface features that characterize Occidental Mindoro are mountains, rivers, hills, valleys, wide plains and some small fresh water lakes..The taller mountains can be found in the interior that it shares with Oriental Mindoro.
Mountain ranges converge on the two central peaks, Mount Halcon in the north, and Mount Baco in the south..There is also a mountain known as bundok ng susong dalaga, the ""Maiden's breast mountain"", that looks like a reclined woman.
The northern part of the province has relatively fewer plains, while the southern parts have wider flatlands..Most of the plains are cultivated fields, with few remaining untouched forests..Significant hilly areas can be found rolling off in Santa Cruz in the north, and in San Jose and Magsaysay in the south..These are grassed-over rather than forested.
There are several major drainage or river systems flowing on a generally westerly course: Mamburao River , Pagbahan, Mompong, Biga, Lumintao, Busuanga and Caguray..Swamp areas are restricted to the south, specially, along the river mouths.
The province is also home to one of the most popular coral reefs in the Philippines, Apo Reef.
Climate
Occidental Mindoro has two distinct weather types: rainy season and dry season..Rains begin to fall in the province in late May, intensifying through June, July, August, September and October, then gradually subsides in November.
On the other hand, dry season starts in November, with rainfall subsiding in intensity, and altogether ceasing in January, February, March and April..March and April are the driest period, with cloudless skies and parched earth characterizing the general area.
Temperature range is from 26 °C (79 °F) in the windy uplands to 32 °C (90 °F) in the lowlands.

The population of Occidental Mindoro in the 2020 census was 525,354 people, with a density of 90 inhabitants per square kilometre or 230 inhabitants per square mile.
Major languages spoken are Tagalog and the Mangyan languages..Tagalog is usually spoken with Batangas dialect both due to its geographical contact with Batangas and Batangueño residents in the province, with great influences from native Mangyan and Visayan languages..Ilokano, Visayan, and Bikolano, are varyingly spokren by people who migrated from the provinces where they are spoken..Occidental Mindoro is a cultural melting pot, populated mostly by recent immigrants.
The indigenous people in the province are the Mangyans (Manguianes in Spanish, Mañguianes in Old Tagalog), consisting of 7 distinct tribes..They occupy the foothills and interior..The Mangyan have inhabited the island since pre-history..They are believed to have originally traveled from Indonesia and settled down for good in the island.
There is much evidence, historical and geophysical, that the Mangyan tribes formerly lived near the coastlines..They were compelled, however, to move into the interior jungles of the island when the inter-island immigrants came, in order to avoid confrontations, which the peace-loving tribes wished to avoid at all costs..They also wished to avoid cultural changes and to preserve their way of life.
Today, the Mangyan number to only around 80,000 (freely moving in and out in both provinces of Oriental and Occidental Mindoro)..But there is no accurate accounting of them since many still live elusively in the upper regions of the island, avoiding contact with lowlanders.
Religion
Like the Eastern half of the island, most of the population of Occidental Mindoro are of Roman Catholic conviction (82%) while minor religions are usually represented by various Christian denominations, Islam, indigenous Philippine folk religions, animism, and atheism.

Occidental Mindoro is an agricultural area devoted to the production of food..Its economic base is rice production (Oryza sativa culture), a Philippine staple crop..It is the leading activity and source of seasonal employment in the province, participated in by almost 80 per cent of the population, including children.
Wetland or lowland rice is a rainy season crop, heavily dependent on water and therefore produced from July (planting season) to October (harvest season)..Tobacco, onions, garlic and vegetables are grown during the dry season (November to May) since they are not water-intensive crops, and require longer photoperiodicity.
Rice, corn, onions, garlic, salt, fishes (both wild and cultured) are some of the relatively significant surpluses produced in the province in exportable quantities..Mangoes, cashew nuts, cooking bananas (saba) and some other fruits grown in upland orchards are among the other exports of Occidental Mindoro that have traditionally contributed to its income..Peanuts are also grown in some parts of the province, as well as cassava, sweet potatoes, ginger and other minor cultivars.
Forest resources include timber and minerals, among them gold, copper, silver, chrome, and non-metallic minerals such as lime for making cement, and greenstones for ornaments..Timber groups include many species of hardwoods, such as mahogany, and other types of trees in high demand for durability.
There is no large industry in the province..The government is the biggest employer, absorbing most of the off-farm labor force..The local electric cooperative, Occidental Mindoro Electric Cooperative (OMECO), is the biggest employer in the private sector, with nearly 150 regular employees..The rest of the population is engaged in private trades.
Problems
There are many multi-faceted problems in Occidental Mindoro's economy..In rice farming, the biggest issue confronting the producers is the high cost of production..This is attributed mainly to the spiraling prices of farm inputs..A study concluded that from 1997 to 2003, the cost of production rose by 47 per cent, while the income derived from marketing rice maintained 1997 levels..There are also confused reports that the average production rate has declined due to the reduced application of necessary farm chemicals..In street language, this means that the farmers simply cut the amount of inputs because they cannot afford the high capital requirements of following all the recommended inputs in the farming calendar.
Another structural problem is the inadequacy of irrigation..Most of the river systems in the province no longer have the demanded volume of water to make irrigation feasible..This is attributed to the greatly deforested watersheds.

Oriental Mindoro (Tagalog: Silangang Mindoro), officially the Province of Oriental Mindoro (Tagalog: Lalawigan ng Silangang Mindoro (Oriental Mindoro)), is a province in the Philippines located on the island of Mindoro under Mimaropa region in Luzon, about 140 kilometres (87 mi) southwest of Manila..The province is bordered by the Verde Island Passage and the rest of Batangas to the north, by Marinduque, Maestre de Campo (or known as Sibale but official name is Concepcion) Island, Tablas Strait and the rest of Romblon to the east, by Semirara and the rest of Caluya Islands, Antique to the south, and by Occidental Mindoro to the west..Calapan, the only city in the island, is the provincial capital and Mimaropa's regional center.
Oriental Mindoro is touted as the country's emerging eco-tourism destination..In 2005, the Philippines was found to be the center of marine fish biodiversity and the home of the most diverse marine ecosystem in the world, by American biologists Kent Carpenter and Victor Springer..Most of the endemic species in the Philippines are found in the Verde Island Passage between Mindoro island and the main island of Luzon..The passage houses 2,983 individual species of algae, corals, crustaceans, mollusks, fishes, marine reptiles, and marine mammals, based on a study conducted by Carpenter and Springer in 2005.
UNESCO declared Puerto Galera a biosphere reserve under its Man and the Biosphere Programme in the 1970s..The Verde Island Passage is at the apex of the so-called Coral Triangle – the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia – which has the distinction of being the ""center of the center of the world's marine biodiversity"" and the ""center of the center of marine shorefish biodiversity"".
History

This section needs expansion..You can help by adding to it..(June 2016)
Japanese occupation era
A Japanese force landed on northeastern Mindoro in the Philippine Islands on 27 February 1942.
Almost three years later, after the invasion of Mindoro by Allied forces, they proceeded to land to Bongabong and heading to and capturing Calapan, the capital of the united Mindoro Province at the time on 24 January 1945.
Philippine independence
Foundation
After World War II, reconstruction and rehabilitation of infrastructure and economy took place on the island, which then constituted a single province..This was partitioned on 13 June 1950 into Oriental Mindoro and Occidental Mindoro by virtue of Republic Act No..505.
In the decades after the War, Mindoro attracted settlers from overpopulated provinces in the Philippines..Apart from the hope to become landowners or to have better tenancy conditions, the Hukbalahap Rebellion in Central Luzon was an important factor for migration..Under the settlement program of the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA) founded in 1954, families from Central Luzon were settled in the Bongabong-Pinamalayan area..This project ended in 1956 after 606 families (3,636 people) were settled on 8,600 hectares (21,000 acres) of public land..Since then, new settlers continue to migrate to Mindoro until today.
Contemporary
On November 15, 1994, a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the Verde Island Passage located north of Oriental Mindoro, killing 69 people in the province, with most casualties due to the tsunami caused by the earthquake.
The island currently sees an ongoing conflict between the Armed Forces of the Philippines and insurgents..On March 6, 2010, eleven soldiers were killed and seven were hurt in a gun battle with the New People's Army in Mansalay, Oriental Mindoro.
Geography
Oriental Mindoro covers a total area of 4,238.38 square kilometres (1,636.45 sq mi) occupying the eastern section of Mindoro island in Mimaropa region..The province is bordered by the Verde Island Passage to the north, by Marinduque, Maestre de Campo, Tablas Strait and the rest of Romblon to the east, by Semirara and the rest of Caluya Islands, Antique to the south, and by Occidental Mindoro to the west.
The western portion of the province is mountainous or rugged, while the east has hills and flood plains..Mount Halcon, standing 2,582 metres (8,471 ft) above sea level, is the 18th highest mountain in the country and is the province's and island's highest peak..Lake Naujan, the fifth largest lake in the country with an area of approximately 8,125 hectares (20,080 acres) of open water, is located at the northeastern part of the island and the province.
Administrative divisions
Oriental Mindoro comprises 14 municipalities, with one city, Calapan serving as the provincial capital.

Palawan (/pəˈlɑːwən/, Tagalog:
Palawan Provincial Capitol in Puerto Princesa.
The islands of Palawan stretch between Mindoro island in the northeast and Borneo in the southwest..It lies between the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea..The province is named after its largest island, Palawan Island (09°30′N 118°30′E﻿ / ﻿9.500°N 118.500°E﻿ / 9.500; 118.500), measuring 450 kilometers (280 mi) long, and 50 kilometers (31 mi) wide.
In 2019, it was proposed to divide Palawan into three separate provinces, though it was later rejected by the local population in a 2021 plebiscite.
History
Pre-history
Further information: Palawan (island) § Prehistory
The early history of Palawan was determined by a team of researchers led by Robert Bradford Fox..They found evidence in the Tabon Caves that humans have lived in Palawan for more than 50,000 years..They also found human bone fragments, from an individual known as Tabon Man, in the municipality of Quezon, as well as tools and other artifacts.
Two articulated phalanx bones of a tiger, besides another phalanx piece, were found amidst an assemblage of other animal bones and stone tools in Ille Cave near the village of New Ibajay..The other animal fossils were ascribed to macaques, deer, bearded pigs, small mammals, lizards, snakes and turtles..From the stone tools, besides the evidence for cuts on the bones, and the use of fire, it would appear that early humans had accumulated the bones.
Using the work of Von den Driesch,
Palawan was a major site for the Maritime Jade Road, one of the most extensive sea-based trade networks of a single geological material in the prehistoric world, operating for 3,000 years from 2000 BCE to 1000 CE.
Early history
Palawan is home to several Indigenous groups..The oldest inhabitants are the Palaw'an, Batak, Tagbanwa, and Tau't Bato who are from the interiors and highlands of Palawan, as well as the Calamianes Islands..They traditionally practice animist anito religions..Palawan's coastlines were also settled by later groups that are now collectively known as ""Palaweños""..Prior to Islamization, the islands of Palawan, Calamian, and parts of Luzon were under the jurisdiction of the nation Sandao (In Chinese records at the 1200s)..Sandao was a vassal-state to the more powerful Ma-i nation in Mindoro..Thereafter, groups like the Islamized Molbog people of southern Palawan (possibly originally from Sabah), and the Cuyonon and Agutaynon groups (from the nearby islands of Cuyo and Agutaya settled in.
Palawan was mentioned as ""Pulaoan"" or ""Polaoan"" by Antonio Pigafetta in 1521 during Magellan's expedition..They called it la terra de missione (""the land of promise"") due to the fact that they were almost starving by the time they reached the island..The local datu made peace with the expedition through a blood compact..The ships' crews were welcomed to the island with rice cooked in bamboo tubes, rice wine, bananas, pigs, goats, chickens, coconuts, sugarcane, and other supplies..Pigafetta described the inhabitants as being farmers..Their primary weapons were blowguns with iron tips that could both shoot thick wooden or bamboo darts (some poisoned) and function as spears once their ammunition were exhausted..Pigafetta also described the islanders as keeping roosters for cockfighting.
Before the arrival of the Spanish in the late 15th century, Palawan broke free of the nation of Ma-i but would be conquered and ruled by Bruneian empire and their vassals the Sultanate of Sulu.
Spanish colonial era
Taytay, the capital of the Province of Calamianes in 1818 (Spanish Palawan)
The northern Calamianes Islands were the first to come under Spanish authority, and were later declared a province separate from the Palawan mainland..In the early 17th century, Spanish friars sent out missions in Cuyo, Agutaya, Taytay and Cagayancillo but they met resistance from Moro communities..Before the 18th century, Colonial Authorities began to build churches enclosed by garrisons for protection against Moro raids in the towns of Cuyo, Taytay, Linapacan and Balabac..In 1749, the Sultanate of Brunei ceded southern Palawan to Spain.
In 1818, the entire island of Palawan, or Paragua as it was called, was organized as a single province named Calamianes, with its capital in Taytay..By 1858, the province was divided into two provinces, namely, Castilla, covering the northern section with Taytay as capital and Asturias in the southern mainland with Puerto Princesa as capital..It was later divided into three districts, Calamianes, Paragua and Balabac, with Principe Alfonso town as its capital..During the Spanish colonial period, Cuyo became the second capital of Palawan from 1873 to 1903.
American colonial era
In 1902, after the Philippine–American War, the United States established civil rule in northern Palawan, calling it the province of Paragua..In 1905, pursuant to Philippine Commission Act No..1363, the province was reorganized to include the southern portions and renamed Palawan, and Puerto Princesa declared as its capital.
Many reforms and projects were later introduced in the province..Construction of school buildings, promotion of agriculture, and bringing people closer to the government were among the priority plans during this era.
Japanese invasion era
U.S. Army personnel worked to identify the charred remains of Americans captured at Bataan and burned alive on Palawan..March 20, 1945
After the Japanese invasion, according to Stephen L. Moore, ""Pro-Allied sentiment was strong, and it was later estimated that during the war as many as 1,154 Filipino guerrillas worked against the Japanese on the island..Those in the underground network would proudly refer to themselves as 'Palawan's Fighting One Thousand'."".Early resistance leaders included Dr. Higinio Acosta Mendoza, his wife Triny, Thomas F. Loudon, and his son-in-law Nazario Mayor..Capt..Mayor organized Company D in October 1943, and was responsible for the area encompassing Puerto Princesa south to Balabac Island..Capt..Mendoza covered the area north of Puerto Princesa to Caramay..Lt. Felipe Batul operated out of Danlig, while Capt..Carlos Amores operated out of Sibaltan..Overall command of the Palawan Special Battalion was under Major Pablo P. Muyco as part of the 6th Military District..The Palawan guerrillas helped any escaping American POWs, supported two coastwatcher groups sending regular radio broadcasts to General MacArthur on Japanese movements, and helped rescue downed airmen as well as survivors from the submarine USS Flier..Most importantly, they helped guide the 8th Army's troop landings.
Palawan Massacre
Main article: Palawan Massacre
During World War II, in order to prevent the rescue of prisoners of war by the advancing allies, on December 14, 1944, units of the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army (under the command of General Tomoyuki Yamashita) herded the remaining 150 prisoners of war at Puerto Princesa into three covered trenches which were then set on fire using barrels of gasoline..Prisoners who tried to escape the flames were shot down.
Liberation
Main article: Invasion of Palawan
During the first phase of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, just off the coast of Palawan, two United States Navy submarines, USS Dace and USS Darter attacked a Japanese cruiser task force led by Admiral Takeo Kurita, sinking his flagship (in which he survived) Atago, and her sister ship Maya..Darter later ran aground that afternoon and was scuttled by USS Nautilus (SS-168).
The island was liberated from the Japanese Imperial Forces from February 28 to April 22, 1945, during the Invasion of Palawan.
Philippine independence
Martial law era
Like the other parts of the Philippines, Palawan felt the impact when Ferdinand Marcos placed the whole country under martial law in September 1972, and then held on to power for 14 more years, until he was ousted by the 1986 EDSA People Power revolution.
One incident was when Marcos evicted an estimated 254 families of Indigenous Tagbanwa people from the Calauit Island in order to create a game reserve full of animals imported from Africa.
In another incident, residents of Bugsuk Island were driven from their homes and communities so that Marcos crony Eduardo Cojuangco could establish a coconut plantation.
Among the leaders who helped organize the effort to prevent the eviction of the Bugsuk Island residents was United Methodist Reverend Magnifico Osorio..When the effort failed, Reverend Osorio relocated to Bataraza, a town on the southernmost tip of Palawan Island, where he continued to fight for the rights of the Indigenous peoples of Palawan..In March 1985 he successfully facilitated a meeting between Indigenous peoples and the provincial governor, who promised to respect Indigenous rights as long as he was governor..A few weeks later, however, Reverend Osorio was found dead out in his ricefields, having been clubbed in the head and shot dead..For his work to protect the Indigenous peoples of Palawan, and for the circumstances of his death, Reverend Osorio was honored by having his name inscribed on the Wall of Remembrance at the Philippines' Bantayog ng mga Bayani, which honors the martyrs and heroes who fought the abuses of the Marcos dictatorship.
Contemporary
In 2005, Palawan was briefly made politically part of Western Visayas or Region VI through Executive Order 429 signed by then-President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on May 23
On July 21, 2007, its capital city Puerto Princesa became a highly urbanized city.
Proposed division
Main article: 2021 Palawan division plebiscite
In April 2019, a bill dividing Palawan into three provinces was passed into law.
Geography
Coron Island
The province is composed of the long and narrow Palawan Island, plus a number of other smaller islands surrounding it, totalling roughly 1,780 islands and islets..The Calamianes Group of Islands to the northeast consists of Busuanga, Coron, Culion, and Linapacan islands..Balabac Island is located off the southern tip, separated from Borneo by the Balabac Strait..In addition, Palawan covers the Cuyo Islands in the Sulu Sea..The disputed Spratly Islands, located a few hundred kilometers to the west, are considered part of Palawan by the Philippines, and is locally called the ""Kalayaan Group of Islands"".
Palawan's almost 2,000 kilometers (1,200 mi) of irregular coastline is lined with rocky coves and sugar-white sandy beaches..It also harbors a vast stretch of virgin forests that carpet its chain of mountain ranges..The mountain heights average 1,100 meters (3,500 ft) in altitude, with the highest peak rising to 6,843 feet (2,086 m)
The province has a total land area of 14,649.73 square kilometers (5,656.29 sq mi)..The land area is distributed to its mainland municipalities, comprising 12,239 square kilometers (4,726 sq mi), and the island municipalities, which altogether measure 2,657 square kilometers (1,026 sq mi)..In terms of archipelagic internal waters, Palawan has the biggest marine resources that covers almost half of the Sulu Sea and a big chunk of the South China Sea that is within the municipal waters of Kalayaan Municipality which was officially annexed to the Philippine jurisdiction by virtue of Presidential Decree 1596 dated June 11, 1978.
Climate
Primary tropical moist rainforest in central Palawan
The province has two types of climate..The first, which occurs in the northern and southern extremities and the entire western coast, has two distinct seasons – six months dry and six months wet..The other, which prevails in the eastern coast, has a short dry season of one to three months and no pronounced rainy period during the rest of the year..The southern part of the province is virtually free from tropical depressions but northern Palawan experiences torrential rains during the months of July and August..Summer months serve as peak season for Palawan..Sea voyages are most favorable from March to early June when the seas are calm..The average maximum temperature is 31 °C (88 °F) with little variation all year.
The island ecosystem of Palawan is threatened by climate change.
Administrative divisions
Political map of Palawan
Palawan comprises 433 barangays in 23 municipalities and the capital City of Puerto Princesa..As an archipelago, Palawan has 13 mainland municipalities and 10 island towns..There are three congressional districts, namely: the first district comprising five northern mainland municipalities and nine island towns; the second district composed of six southern mainland towns and the island municipality of Balabac; and the third district covering the capital City of Puerto Princesa and the town of Aborlan..Thirteen municipalities are considered as mainland municipalities, namely Aborlan, Narra, Quezon, Sofronio Española, Brooke's Point, Rizal, and Bataraza (located south); San Vicente, Roxas, Dumaran, El Nido, and Taytay (found in the north)..The remaining island municipalities are: Busuanga, Coron, Linapacan and Culion (forming the Calamianes group of islands), Cuyo, Agutaya and Magsaysay (the Cuyo group of islands), Araceli, Cagayancillo, Balabac and Kalayaan (Spratly Islands)..The capital, Puerto Princesa is a highly urbanized city that governs itself independently from the province, but it usually grouped with the province for statistical and geographic purposes.

Pampanga, officially the Province of Pampanga (Kapampangan: Lalawigan ning Pampanga; Tagalog: Lalawigan ng Pampanga IPA:  pəm-PAHNG-ga), is a province in the Central Luzon region of the Philippines..Lying on the northern shore of Manila Bay, Pampanga is bordered by Tarlac to the north, Nueva Ecija to the northeast, Bulacan to the east, Manila Bay to the central-south, Bataan to the southwest and Zambales to the west..Its capital is the City of San Fernando..Angeles City is the largest LGU, but while geographically within Pampanga, it is classified as a first-class, highly urbanized city and has been governed independently of the province since it received its charter in 1964.
The name La Pampanga was given by the Spaniards, who encountered natives living along the banks (pampáng) of the Pampanga River..Its creation in 1571 makes it the first Spanish province on Luzon Island (Cebu in Visayas is older as it was founded by the Spaniards in 1565)..The town of Villa de Bacolor in the province briefly served as the Spanish colonial capital when Great Britain invaded Manila as part of the Seven Years' War..At the eve of the Philippine Revolution of 1896, Pampanga was one of eight provinces placed under martial law for rebellion against the Spanish Empire; it is thus represented on the Philippine national flag as one of the eight rays of the sun.
Pampanga is served by Clark International Airport (formerly Diosdado Macapagal International Airport), which is in Clark Freeport Zone, some 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) north of the provincial capital..The province is home to two Philippine Air Force airbases: Basa Air Base in Floridablanca and the former United States Clark Air Base in Angeles..Due to its growing population and developments, the Clark Global City is now developed and is located in Clark Freeport Zone..In 2015, the province had 2,198,110 inhabitants,

Historical marker created by the National Historical Institute in 1982 to commemorate the province and installed at the provincial capitol
Ancient Pampanga's Territorial area included portions of the modern provinces of Tarlac, Bataan, Zambales, Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Aurora, and Tondo; i.e..covered almost the entire Central Luzon..For better administration and taxation purposes, the Spanish authorities subdivided Pampanga into pueblos, which were further subdivided into districts (barrios) and in some cases into royal and private estates (encomiendas).
Due to excessive abuses committed by some encomenderos, King Philip II of Spain in 1574 prohibited the further awarding of private estates, but this decree was not fully enforced until 1620..In a report of Philippine encomiendas on June 20, 1591, Governor-General Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas reported to the Crown that La Pampanga's encomiendas were Bataan, Betis y Lubao, Macabebe, Candaba, Apalit, Calumpit, Malolos, Binto, Guiguinto, Caluya, Bulacan and Mecabayan..The encomiendas of La Pampanga at that time had eighteen thousand six hundred and eighty whole tributes.
Pampanga, which is about 850 square miles (2,200 km2) in area and inhabited by more than 1.5 million people, had its present borders drawn in 1873..During the Spanish regime, it was one of the richest Philippine provinces..Manila and its surrounding region were then primarily dependent on Kapampangan agricultural, fishery and forestry products as well as on the supply of skilled workers..As other Luzon provinces were created due to increases in population, some well-established Pampanga towns were lost to new emerging provinces in Central Luzon.
During the 17th century, The Dutch recruited men from Pampanga as mercenaries who served the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army, known as Papangers however, there are few traces of their descendants, except for a small community in Kampung Tugu.
The historic province of Bataan which was founded in 1754 under the administration of Spanish Governor-General Pedro Manuel Arandia, absorbed from the province of Pampanga the municipalities of Abucay, Balanga (now a city), Dinalupihan, Llana Hermosa, Orani, Orion, Pilar, and Samal..During the British occupation of Manila (1762–1764), Bacolor became the provisional Spanish colonial capital and military base..By the end of the 1700s, Pampanga had 16,604 native families and 2,641 Spanish Filipino families,: 460
The old Pampanga towns of Aliaga, Cabiao, Gapan, San Antonio and San Isidro were ceded to the province of Nueva Ecija in 1848 during the term of Spanish Governor-General Narciso Claveria y Zaldua..The municipality of San Miguel de Mayumo of Pampanga was yielded to the province of Bulacan in the same provincial boundary configuration in 1848.
In 1860, the northern towns of Bamban, Capas, Concepcion, Victoria, Tarlac, Mabalacat, Magalang, Porac and Floridablanca were separated from Pampanga and were placed under the jurisdiction of a military command called Comandancia Militar de Tarlac..However, in 1873, the four latter towns were returned to Pampanga and the other five became municipalities of the newly created Province of Tarlac.
Japanese invasion era
On December 8, 1941, Japanese planes bombed Clark Air Base marking the beginning of the invasion of Pampanga..Between 1941 and 1942, occupying Japanese forces began entering Pampanga.
During the counter-insurgencies under the Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1944, Kapampangan guerrilla fighters and the Hukbalahap Communist guerrillas fought side by side in the province of Pampanga, attacking and retreating the Japanese Imperial forces for over three years of fighting and invasion.
The establishment of the military general headquarters and military camp bases of the Philippine Commonwealth Army was active from 1935 to 1946..The Philippine Constabulary was active from 1935 to 1942 and 1944 to 1946 in the province of Pampanga..During the military engagements of the anti-Japanese Imperial military operations in central Luzon from 1942 to 1945 in the province of Bataan, Bulacan, Northern Tayabas (now Aurora), Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Tarlac, and Zambales, the local guerrilla resistance fighters and Hukbalahap Communist guerrillas, helped the U.S. military forces fight the Imperial Japanese armed forces.
In the 1945 liberation of Pampanga, Kapampangan guerrilla fighters and the Hukbalahap Communist guerrillas supported combat forces from Filipino and American ground troops in attacking Japanese Imperial forces during the Battle of Pampanga until the end of the Second World War..Local military operations soldiers and officers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army 2nd, 26th, 3rd, 32nd, 33rd, 35th, 36th and 37th Infantry Division and the Philippine Constabulary 3rd Constabulary Regiment recaptured and liberated the province of Pampanga and fought against the Japanese Imperial forces during the Battle of Pampanga.

Under a 1947 Military Bases Agreement,
During the Marcos dictatorship
Main articles: Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos, Political detainees under the Marcos dictatorship, and Human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship
See also: US Bases in the Philippines
Due to its proximity to the capital and the presence of Clark Air Base, Pampanga was became one of the flashpoint of social upheavals of the early 1970s, and the ensuing dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos.
Upon the declaration of Martial Law in September 1972, Camp Olivas in the City of San Fernando  was designated as one of the four provincial camps to become a Regional Command for Detainees (RECAD)..It was designated RECAD I and it housed detainees from Northern and Central Luzon.
Others were killed without being arrested, such as close friends Pepito Deheran, Rolando Castro and Lito Cabrera were sleeping in Cabrera's property in Sapang Bato, Angeles when they were attacked, captured, and tortured by Marcos' Civilian Home Defense Force militia forces after they participated in the protest movement that grew out of the assassination of opposition leader Ninoy Aquino..Deheran managed to escape the ordeal alive and was taken to the hospital, but was stabbed by unknown assailants in his own hospital bed.
Jennifer Cariño, the Palabay brothers, Macli-ing Dulag, Castro, Cabrera, and Deheran would later be honored by having their names inscribed on the wall of remembrance of the Philippines' Bantayog ng mga Bayani, which honors the martyrs and heroes who dared to resist the dictatorship.
Mount Pinatubo eruption and closure of Clark Air Base
Main articles: 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo and Clark Air Base
Major events that took place in Pampanga after the People Power revolution include the Mount Pinatubo eruption and the end of the Philippines' Bases Treaty with the United States, which resulted in the closure of Clark Air Base and the later creation of the Clark Freeport and Special Economic Zone.
The June 15, 1991, eruption of Mount Pinatubo displaced a large number of people with the submersion of whole towns and villages by massive lahar floods..This led to a large-scale advancement in disaster preparation in government..It also hastened the closure of Clark Air Base, which was already due to close as a result of the November 1991 decision of the Philippine senate not to renew the Philippines' Bases treaty with the United States.
Creation of the Clark Freeport and Special Economic Zone
Main article: Clark Freeport and Special Economic Zone
1992 saw the signing of the Bases Conversion and Development Act (Republic Act 7227 ser..1992), which authorized the President to issue a decree converting the military reservation in the Clark area covering Angeles City, Mabalacat, and Porac, Pampanga and Capas, Tarlac into a special economic zone..The legislation also created the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) to facilitate the conversion process.
The Clark Air Base area would later be declared a Freeport Zone and was separated from the special economic zone through Republic Act 9400 of 2007 Since then the Freeport Zone and the Clark Special Economic Zone were considered as separate areas but collectively they are referred to as the ""Clark Freeport and Special Economic Zone"".
Contemporary

Pangasinan, officially the Province of Pangasinan (Pangasinan: Luyag/Probinsia na Pangasinan,  The western portion of the province is part of the homeland of the Sambal people, while the central and eastern portions are the homeland of the Pangasinan people..Due to ethnic migration, the Ilocano people settled in the province.
Pangasinan is the name of the province, the people and the spoken language..Indigenous Pangasinan speakers are estimated to number at least 2 million..The Pangasinan language, which is official in the province, is one of the officially recognized regional languages in the Philippines..Several ethnic groups enrich the cultural fabric of the province..Almost all of the people are Pangasinans and the rest are descendants of the Bolinao and Ilocano who settled the eastern and western parts of the province..Pangasinan is spoken as a second language by many ethnic minorities in Pangasinan..The minority ethnic groups are the Bolinao-speaking Zambals, and Ilocanos.
Popular tourist attractions in Pangasinan include the Hundred Islands National Park in Alaminos the white-sand beaches of Bolinao and Dasol..Dagupan is known for its Bangus Festival (""Milkfish Festival"")..Pangasinan is also known for its mangoes and ceramic oven-baked Calasiao puto (""native rice cake"")..Pangasinan occupies a strategic geo-political position in the central plain of Luzon..Pangasinan has been described as the gateway to northern Luzon.
Etymology
The name Pangasinan means ""place of salt"" or ""place of salt-making""; it is derived from the prefix pang-, meaning ""for"", the root word asin, meaning ""salt”, and suffix -an, signifying ""location""..The Spanish form of the province's name, Pangasinán, remains predominant, albeit without diacritics and so does its pronunciation: ..The province is a major producer of salt in the Philippines..Its major products include bagoong (""shrimp-paste"") and alamang (""salted-krill"").
History
Early history
Main article: Caboloan
Pangasinan, like the rest of the Philippine islands, was settled by Austronesian peoples by sea during the Austronesian expansion..They established settlements along the Lingayen Gulf and was part of the ancient Austronesian trade routes to India, China, and Japan, since at least the 8th century AD..The primary industry along the coastal areas was salt-making, which is the origin of the name ""Pangasinan"" (""place of salt-making"")..The interior lands were called ""Caboloan"" (""place of bolo bamboos""), referring to the abundance of bolo bamboo (Gigantochloa levis).
Pangasinan is identified with ""Feng-chia-hsi-lan"" which appears in Ming Dynasty Chinese records..They are believed to have sent emissaries to China with symbolic ""tributes"" from 1403 to 1405, which was required to establish trade relations.
In the sixteenth-century Pangasinan was called the ""Port of Japan"" by the Spanish..The locals wore native apparel typical of other maritime Southeast Asian ethnic groups in addition to Japanese and Chinese silks..Even common people were clad in Chinese and Japanese cotton garments..They blackened their teeth and were disgusted by the white teeth of foreigners which were likened to that of animals..They used porcelain jars typical of Japanese and Chinese households..Japanese-style gunpowder weapons were encountered in naval battles in the area..In exchange for these goods, traders from all over Asia would come to trade primarily for gold and slaves, but also deerskins, civet and other local products..Other than a notably more extensive trade network with Japan and China they were culturally similar to other Luzon groups to the south.
Pangasinans were also described as a warlike people who were known for their resistance to Spanish conquest..Bishop Domingo Salazar described Pangasinans as the fiercest and cruelest in the land..They were untouched by Christianity but like Christians they used vintage wine in small quantities for sacramental practices..The church bragged that they, not the Spanish military, won the northern part of the Philippines for Spain..The church was strict with adulterers; the punishment was death for both parties..Pangasinans were known to take defeated Sambal, (Aeta) and Negrito warriors to sell as slaves to Chinese traders.
Christianity
In 1324, Odoric of Pordenone, a Franciscan missionary from Friuli, Italy, is believed by some to have celebrated a Catholic Mass and baptized natives at Bolinao..In July 2007, memorial markers were set up in Bolinao to commemorate Odoric's journey, based on a publication by Luigi Malamocco..The 1324 mass would have predated the mass held in 1521 by Ferdinand Magellan which is generally regarded as the first mass in the Philippines by some 197 years..However, historian William Henry Scott concluded after examining Oderic's writings about his travels that he likely never set foot on Philippine soil and if he did, there is no reason to think that he celebrated mass.
Spanish colonial era
On April 27, 1565, the Spanish conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi arrived in the Philippine islands with about 500 soldiers and established a Spanish settlement..On May 24, 1570, the Spanish forces defeated Rajah Sulayman and other rulers of Manila and later declared Manila the capital of the Spanish East Indies..After securing Manila, the Spanish forces conquered the rest of the island of Luzon, including Pangasinan.
Provincia de Pangasinán
In 1571, the Spanish conquest of Pangasinan began with an expedition by the Spanish conquistador Martín de Goiti, who came from the Spanish settlement in Manila through Pampanga..About a year later another Spanish conquistador, Juan de Salcedo, sailed to Lingayen Gulf and landed at the mouth of the Agno River..Limahong, a Chinese pirate, fled to Pangasinan after his fleet was driven away from Manila in 1574..Limahong failed to establish a colony in Pangasinan, as an army led by de Salcedo chased him out of Pangasinan after a seven-month siege.
Pangasinan as a province dates back to an administrative and judicial district as early as 1580, with Lingayen as the capital,  but its territorial boundaries were first delineated in 1611..Lingayen has remained the capital of the province except for a brief period during the revolutionary era when San Carlos City served as temporary administrative headquarters and during the slightly longer Japanese occupation, when Dagupan was the capital.
The province of Pangasinan was formerly classified as an alcaldía mayor de término or first class civil province during the Spanish regime and has remained a first class-A province to the present..Its territorial jurisdiction once included most of the province of Zambales and portions of what are now Tarlac and La Union provinces.
By the end of the 1700s, Pangasinan had 19,836 native families and 719 Spanish Filipino families..: 31, 54, 113
Rebellion against the Spanish rule
Malong liberation
Andres Malong, a native chief of the town of Binalatongan (now named San Carlos City), liberated the province from Spanish rule in December 1660..The people of Pangasinan proclaimed Andres Malong Ari na Pangasinan (""King of Pangasinan"")..Pangasinan armies attempted to liberate the neighboring provinces of Pampanga and Ilocos, but were repelled by a Spanish-led coalition of loyalist tribal warriors and mercenaries..In February 1661, the newly independent Kingdom of Pangasinan fell to the Captaincy General of the Philippines.
Palaris liberation
On November 3, 1762, the people of Pangasinan proclaimed independence from Spain after a rebellion led by Juan de la Cruz Palaris..The Pangasinan revolt was sparked by news that Manila had fallen to the British on October 6, 1762..The Traité de Paris ended the Seven Years' War between Britain, France and Spain on March 1, 1763..On January 16, 1765, Juan de la Cruz Palaris was captured and Pangasinan independence was lost again.

The Katipunan, a nationalist secret society, was founded on July 7, 1892, with the aim of uniting the peoples of the Philippines in the fight for independence and religious freedom..The Philippine Revolution began on August 26, 1896, and was led by the leader of the Katipunan, Andres Bonifacio..On November 18, 1897, a Katipunan council was formed in western Pangasinan with Presidente Generalisimo Roman Manalang and General Mauro Ortiz..General Emilio Aguinaldo proclaimed Philippine independence on June 12, 1898..Dagupan, the major commercial center of Pangasinan, was surrounded by Katipunan forces on July 18, 1898..The Battle of Dagupan lasted from July 18 to 23 of that year with the surrender of 1,500 Spanish soldiers under Commander Federico J. Ceballos and Governor Joaquin de Orengochea.
The Battle of Dagupan was fought by local Katipuneros under the command of General Francisco Makabulos and the last remnants of the once mighty Spanish Army under General Francisco Ceballos..Three local heroes fought in the five-day battle, Don Daniel Maramba of Santa Barbara, Don Vicente Prado of San Jacinto and Don Juan Quezada of Dagupan..Their armies amassed in Dagupan making a last stand at the brick-walled Catholic Church.

Maramba led the liberation of the town of Santa Barbara on March 7, 1898, following a signal for simultaneous attack from Makabulos..Hearing that Santa Barbara fell to the rebels Spanish forces in Dagupan attempted to retake the town but were repelled by Maramba's forces..After the setback the Spanish decided to concentrate their forces in Lingayen in order to protect the provincial capital..This allowed Maramba to expand his operations to include Malasiqui, Urdaneta and Mapandan which he defeated in succession..He then defeated the town of Mangaldan before proceeding to the last Spanish garrison in Dagupan..On March 7, 1898, rebels under the command of Prado and Quesada attacked convents in the province of Zambales which now constitute western Pangasinan.
Attacked and brought under Filipino control were Alaminos, Agno, Anda, Alos, Bani, Balincaguin, Bolinao, Dasol, Eguia and Potot..The revolt then spread to Labrador, Sual, Salasa and many other towns in the west..The towns of Sual, Labrador, Lingayen, Salasa and Bayambang were occupied first by the forces of Prado and Quesada before they attacked Dagupan.
On April 17, 1898, General Makabulos appointed Prado to politico-military governor of Pangasinan with Quesada as his second in command..In May 1898 General Emilio Aguinaldo returned from his exile in Hong Kong following the signing of the Pact of Biac-na-Bato in December 1897..Aguinaldo's return gave renewed the flames of the revolution..On June 3, 1898, General Makabulos entered Tarlac.
So successful were the Katipunan in their many pitched battles against Spanish forces that on June 30, 1898, Spanish authorities decided to evacuate all forces to Dagupan for a last stand against the rebels..They were ordered to go to Dagupan were all civilian and military personnel, including members of the volunteer locales of towns not yet in rebel hands..Those who heeded this order were the volunteer forces of Mangaldan, San Jacinto, Pozorrubio, Manaoag, and Villasis..Among the items brought to Dagupan was the image of the Most Holy Rosary of the Virgin of Manaoag which was the patron saint of Pangasinan.
The siege began when the forces of Maramba and Prado converged in Dagupan on July 18, 1898..The arrival of General Makabulos strengthened the rebel forces until the Spanish, holed up inside the Catholic Church, waved the flag of surrender five days later..The poorly armed Filipino rebels were no match for the Spanish and loyal Filipino soldiers holed inside the Church..The tempo of battle changed when the attackers under the command of Don Vicente Prado devised a crude means of protection to shield them from Spanish fire while advancing..They used trunks of bananas bundled up in sawali which enabled them to move upon the Church.
American invasion era
Northwest Nueva Ecija to Pangasinan
In 1901, towns of Nueva Ecija, Balungao, Rosales, San Quintin and Umingan were annexed to the province of Pangasinan, because they were further away from the capital and already considered pacified by US forces.
Northern Zambales ceded to Pangasinan
On November 30, 1903, several municipalities from northern Zambales including Agno, Alaminos, Anda, Bani, Bolinao, Burgos, Dasol, Infanta and Mabini were ceded to Pangasinan by the American colonial government..These municipalities were a part of the homeland of the Sambal people who wanted to remain within the Zambales province..This 1903 colonial decision has yet to be reverted.
Pangasinan and other parts of the Spanish East Indies were ceded to the Americans after the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Spanish–American War..During the Philippine–American War Lieutenant Col. José Torres Bugallón of Salasa fought together with Gen. Antonio Luna to defend the First Philippine Republic against American colonization in Northern Luzon..Bugallon was killed in battle on February 5, 1899..The First Philippine Republic was abolished in 1901..In 1907 the Philippine Assembly was established and for the first time five residents of Pangasinan were elected as its district representatives..In 1921, Mauro Navarro, representing Pangasinan in the Philippine Assembly, sponsored a law to rename the town of Salasa to Bugallon in  honor of General Bugallon.
Manuel L. Quezon was inaugurated as the first president of the Commonwealth of the Philippines with collaboration from the United States of America on November 15, 1935.
The 21st Infantry Division were stationed in Pangasinan during the pre-World War II era..Anti-Japanese Imperial military operations included the fall of Bataan and Corregidor along with aiding the USAFFE ground force from January to May 1942 and the Japanese Insurgencies and Allied Liberation in Pangasinan from 1942 to 1945.
Postwar era
After the declaration of Independence on July 4, 1946, Eugenio Perez, a Liberal Party congressman representing the fourth district of Pangasinan, was elected Speaker of the lower Legislative House..He led the House until 1953 when the Nacionalista Party became the dominant party.
During the Marcos dictatorship
Main articles: Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos and Human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship
Pangasinan, which is historically and geographically part of the Central Luzon Region, was made politically part of the Ilocos Region (Region I) by the gerrymandering of Ferdinand Marcos, even though Pangasinan has a distinct language and culture, Pangasinan..The political classification of Pangasinan as part of the Ilocos Region  generated confusion among some Filipinos..The residents of Pangasinan are Ilocanos, even though Ilocanos constitute a minority in the province..Its economy is larger than the Ilocano provinces of Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur and La Union and its population is more than 50 percent of the population of Region 1.
The Philippine economy took a turn for the worse in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis being one of the early landmark events.
The human rights abuses, crony capitalism, propagandistic construction projects, and personal expensive lifestyles of the Marcos Family: 174  Among the most prominent human rights violations victims the regime were student leader Eduardo Aquino who was from Mapandan, Pangasinan and beauty queen turned activist Maita Gomez of Bautista, Pangasinan..Aquino was ambushed by Soldiers during a meeting of activists in Tarlac, while Gomez was jailed numerous times, but survived to be co-founder of women's rights group GABRIELA..Both were eventually recognized by having their names posthumously inscribed on the wall of remembrance of the Philippines' Bantayog ng mga Bayani, which honors the martyrs and heroes which fought the dictatorship.
During and after the People Power revolution
In February 1986, both the COMELEC and the NAMFREL counts showed that Corazon Aquino had won the city of Dagupan (in the north along with the provinces of Benguet and Mountain Province) during the 1986 Philippine presidential election, Weeks later, Vice Chief of Staff General Fidel V. Ramos, a Pangasinense who was head of the Philippine Integrated National Police, became an instrumental figure in the EDSA people power revolution which removed Ferdinand Marcos and compelled him to flee the country.
After the downfall of Marcos all local government unit executives were ordered by President Corazon Aquino to vacate their posts..Some local executives were ordered to return to their seats, as in the case of Mayor Ludovico Espinosa of Dasol, who claimed to have joined UNIDO during the height of the EDSA Revolution..Fidel Ramos was appointed as AFP Chief of Staff and later as Defense Secretary replacing Juan Ponce Enrile..Oscar Orbos, a congressman from Bani, was appointed by Aquino to head the Department of Transportation and Communications and later to Executive Secretary.
On May 11, 1992, Fidel V. Ramos ran for President..He became the first Pangasinense President of the Philippines..Under his leadership, the Philippines recovered from the oil and power crisis of 1991..His influence sparked the economic growth of Pangasinan when it hosted the 1995 Palarong Pambansa (Philippine National Games).
Jose de Venecia, who represented the same district as Eugenio Perez, was the second Pangasinense to become Speaker of the House of Representatives in 1992..He was reelected again in 1995..De Venecia was selected by the Ramos' administration party Lakas NUCD to be its presidential candidate in 1998..De Venecia ran but lost to Vice President Joseph Estrada..Oscar Orbos ran for vice president but lost to Senator Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, whose mother, former First Lady Evangelina Macaraeg-Macapagal, hails from Binalonan.
Arroyo ascended to the presidency after the second EDSA Revolution when President Joseph Estrada was overthrown.
Contemporary
In May 2004, actor-turned-politician Fernando Poe, Jr. of San Carlos City ran for president against incumbent Gloria Macapagal Arroyo..The Pangasinan vote was split by the two presidential candidates, both with Pangasinan roots..Arroyo was elected president but her victory was tainted by charges of electoral fraud and vote-buying.

Quezon, Lucena, the provincial capital, the seat of the provincial government, and the most populous city of the province, is governed independently from the province as a highly urbanized city..To distinguish the province from Quezon City, it is sometimes called Quezon Province, a variation of the province's official name.
Quezon is southeast of Metro Manila and is bordered by the provinces of Aurora to the north, Bulacan, Rizal, Laguna and Batangas to the west and the provinces of Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur to the east..Part of Quezon lies on an isthmus connecting the Bicol Peninsula to the main part of Luzon..The province also includes the Polillo Islands in the Philippine Sea..Some marine parts of the Verde Island Passage, the center of the center of world's marine biodiversity, are also in the province.
A major tourism draw to the province is Mount Banahaw..The mountain is surrounded by spiritual mysticism with many Anitist adherents, Christian cults, and Christian organizations staying on the mountain..The mountain was also one of the most sacred sites for pre-colonial Tagalog people before the arrival of the Spanish..Numerous pilgrims visit the mountain especially during Holy Week.
History
Early history
Archaeological excavations in the province attest to its rich precolonial past..Archaeological materials including burial jars, human bones, shell midden and pot shreds have been discovered at different sites in Bondoc Peninsula including the towns of San Narciso, San Andres, Mulanay and Catanauan..The most recent excavations were conducted in Catanauan by the Catanauan Archeological and Heritage Project.
According to the preliminary report released by the Catanauan Archaeological and Heritage Project, several excavations were conducted in the 1930s..One of the excavations was conducted in San Narciso where archaeologists found burial jars..The site, inspected by Ricardo Galang, resulted in the discovery of burial jars near the coast..Galang also went to San Andres where excavations yielded 14th and 15th century ceramics as well as shell bracelets and beads..According to the journal as well, at a site named Tala, archaeologists discovered a glazed Chinese jar containing bone fragments from the early Ming dynasty..Looking at other archaeological sites located in adjacent areas like Marinduque and Masbate, it can be inferred that these excavations date back to the metal period of the archipelago.
In 2012, at Mt..Kamhantik in the town of Mulanay, 15 limestone coffins were discovered..Carbon dating on a human tooth found it to be at least 1,000 years old..According to the archaeologists, the village is proof that the ancient inhabitants of the area practiced a more sophisticated way of life..Metal tools are believed to have been used to carve the coffins, and this is the first of its kind discovered in the archipelago..The remains are said to date back to the 10th to 14th century.
Spanish colonial era
Territorial evolution of Quezon.
Originally, what now forms Quezon was divided among the provinces of Batangas, Laguna, and Nueva Ecija..However, at different points in time, the boundaries of Quezon changed and included parts of Aurora, Marinduque, and Camarines Norte..At the early period of Spanish colonization, the province of Aurora was called El Principe, Infanta was called Binangonan de Lampon, and southern Quezon was called Kalilayan..The first European to explore the area was Juan de Salcedo in 1571–1572, during his expedition from Laguna to Camarines provinces.
In 1574, Father Diego de Oropesa founded the town of Bumaka, now known as the municipality of Gumaca.
In 1591, through Governor General Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas, the province was created and was called Kaliraya or Kalilayan, after the capital town which later became Unisan.
In 1595, the Diocese of Cáceres was established by Pope Clement VIII as a suffragan of Manila..The diocese covered the entire Bicolandia region plus the towns in Kalilayan, and the Contracosta towns..At that time, the towns on the eastern seaboard were pertained to as the Contracosta and included towns from Mauban, Binangonan de Lampon, to El Principe.
The destruction of Kalilayan in 1604 by a big fleet of Moro pirates caused the inhabitants to transfer to Palsabangon (Pagbilao)..Depredation and plunder by the Moros from Jolo and Brunei were rampant during the 1600s..Slavery is one reason for the proliferation of these raids..A padron for Calilaya was ordered after Tayabas suffered severely from Moro raids..It is said that 187 people were either captured or killed while 400 people fled..Fear from these raids are the primary reason as to the permanent movement of settlements along the coast further inland as well as a general decline in population..Frequent invasions by the moros disrupted the food production in the province, affecting the nutrition of its inhabitants..Maternal malnutrition was even cited as one of the primary causes of infant mortality at that time..By 1701, the previously densely settled coastal areas of the province, was described as consisting of rancherias whose inhabitants depended on wild products.
In 1705, the Military Comandancia of Nueva Ecija was created and was governed by Governor General Fausto Cruzat y Góngora..It included huge swathes of Central Luzon, the Contracosta towns as well as the Kalilayan area and Polillo Islands.
In 1749, the capital was transferred to the town of Tayabas, from which the province got its new name.
In a report by a Spanish priest named Fr..Bartolome Galan in 1823, he describes the economy of the province..According to his report, Tayabas had poor soil and the terrain is hilly which meant that conditions were not that suitable for agriculture compared to other places..The people grew upland rice, wheat, beans and vegetables..Surplus rice was sold in San Pablo and Majayjay on Mondays, the market day of those towns..Cattle breeding was rampant in towns like Tayabas, Pagbilao, Tiaong, and Sariaya..Also, unlike other provinces, haciendas were not so many in Tayabas..Instead, residents owned most of their own land.
The people of Tayabas, as in other areas, are actively trading with Manila..Santa Cruz, Laguna, was the entrepot for all goods going to the capital..The people from Lucban made products of buri and pandan leaves like hats, sleeping mata and the like which they traded..They, along with the people of Mauban also went to Polillo, at that time part of Nueva Ecija, to buy sea slugs, shells and beeswax..Being a rich agricultural area, the town of Tayabas traded rice, coconuts, and panocha with nearby towns of Majayjay, Lucban, Sariaya, Pagbilao, Mauban, Gumaca, and Atimonan..In turn, they traded fish from Pagbilao, rice from Sariaya, and high quality abaca products from Mauban and Atimonan..Lucban, as well as Tayabas, benefitted greatly from the high commercial activity of Chinese and Chinese mestizos in the pueblos.
Gumaca, being a town with little arable land depended heavily on the sea..They collected sea slugs, and tortoise shell from Alabat and traded with the mountain people there for beeswax in exchange for clothing..They even sometimes ventured to Burias Island in Ragay Gulf in search for these goods..These products were then sent to Tayabas for shipment to Manila..Gumaca also traded items from nearby pueblos like vinegar and clothing for gold and abaca from Naga in the Bicol region.
In 1818, Nueva Ecija annexed the towns of Palanan from Isabela, as well as Baler, Casiguran, Infanta (formerly called Binangonan de Lampon) and Polillo Islands from Tayabas, and Cagayan, Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino, and part of Rizal.
In 1853, the new military district of Tayabas was carved from Nueva Ecija and included present-day Southern Quezon as well as present-day Aurora..In 1858, Binangonan de Lampon and the Polillo Islands were separated from Nueva Ecija to form part of Infanta.
Between 1855 and 1885, El Principe was established as its own Military Comandancia with its capital in Baler.
Tayabas Uprising
It was also around this time that the Confradia de San Jose was active in the province, caused by the growing inequality between the poor and the upper classes..This organization was directed mostly on the poor and neither admitted Spaniards nor mestizos.
After years under the Spanish regime, the colonized people grew discontented with the Spaniards over the centuries..The most important event in the history of the province was the Confradia Revolt in 1841, which was led by the famous Lucbanin, Apolinario de la Cruz, popularly known as Hermano Pule.

Years after the Cofradia Revolt, on January 20, 1843, the Tayabas Regiment, led by Sergeant Irineo Samaniego, rose in revolt against Spain, conquering Fort Santiago and other areas of Intramuros..This is the only native force in Philippine history to successfully capture Fort Santiago and Manila..For the first time, the word ""Independence"" was shouted by the Tayabas Regiment, encouraging their countrymen to revolt against Spain..The next day, however, the gates of Fort Santiago were opened by loyalist soldiers..After a bloody battle, the mutineers were defeated by loyalist troops, resulting in the execution of Samaniego and 81 of his followers the same day.
The province, under General Miguel Malvar, was also among the earliest to join the Philippine Revolution..The Revolutionary Government took control over the province on August 15, 1898.
American invasion era
Tayabas province in 1918Northern portionSouthern portion
The Americans then came and annexed the Philippines..A civil government was established in the province on March 12, 1901, and Lucena was made the provincial capital.
During the pacification of the archipelago by the Americans, insurrections were a commonplace in what was then Tayabas..Insurgents from neighboring provinces of Laguna and Batangas often use Tayabas as their base of operations as well as their source of supplies..An insurgent government, with connections to Gen. Malvar and Pedro Caballes was even said to be based in Infanta..This has led the American in charge, Brigadier-General J.F..Bell to decide to return to Tayabas with a larger contingent..Bell acknowledged the importance of the ports of Tayabas as sources of supplies to the insurrection such that he believed that closing all the ports in the province might convince the leaders of the resistance to surrender.
In 1902, the district of El Principe was transferred from the jurisdiction of Nueva Ecija to Tayabas..The present areas of north Aurora which is part of the modern Dilasag and area of modern Casiguran were transferred from the authority of Nueva Vizcaya to Tayabas in 1905..In 1918, the area of modern Aurora north of Baler was transferred to the authority of Nueva Vizcaya, but returned to Tayabas in 1946.
Because of the distance between Tayabas and Bicol and the growing population, Tayabas came under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Lipa in 1910.
Japanese occupation era
Japanese occupation of the province during World War II began on December 23, 1941, when the Japanese Imperial Army landed in Atimonan..The General Headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary was stationed in Tayabas from January 3, 1942, to June 30, 1946, are military operates against the Japanese Occupation.
Philippine independence
Name change from Tayabas to Quezon
After the war, on September 7, 1946, Republic Act No..14 changed the name Tayabas to Quezon, in honor of Manuel L. Quezon, the Commonwealth president who hailed from Baler, which was one of the province's towns; he was elected governor of Tayabas in 1906 and congressman of 1st district of Tayabas in 1907.
Rise of the coconut industry
Even before the Philippines gained its independence, the province has already depended heavily on coconuts..This history can clearly be seen through the opulent houses built in the town of Sariaya during this period..Coconuts served as the main source of income for the landed class of Sariaya and this allowed them to build the ancestral houses that we see today.
Establishment of the Province of Aurora
In June 1951, the northern part of Quezon (specifically, the towns of Baler, Casiguran, Dilasag, Dingalan, Dinalongan, Dipaculao, Maria Aurora and San Luis) was made into the sub-province of Aurora.
During the Marcos dictatorship
Main article: Dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos
Quezon Province was not spared the social and economic turmoil during the Dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, including his 1971 suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, his 1972 declaration of martial law, and his continued hold on power from the lifting of martial law in 1981 until his ouster under the People Power Revolution of 1986..One major event that took place during this period was the Guinayangan massacre of February 1, 1981, in which Military elements opened fire on a group of about coconut farmers who were marching towards the Guinayangan plaza air to protest the coco levy fund scam..Two people were killed and 27 were wounded.
Among the Quezon citizens who were victims of forced disappearances during the Marcos dictatorship were human rights worker Albert Enriquez of Lucena, who documented military abuses as a volunteer for Task Force Detainees of the Philippines; and activist Ramon Jasul who founded the Bagong Kabataan ng Lukban (New Youth of Lucban) in his hometown..Enriquez was abducted by armed men on Aug. 29, 1985,
Contemporary
Quezon–Camarines Norte boundary dispute
In 1989, the province of Quezon, represented by Governor Hjalmar Quintana, was involved in a boundary dispute with the province of Camarines Norte, represented by Roy Padilla, over 9 barangays of over 8,000 hectares (20,000 acres) at their border..These barangays are Kagtalaba, Plaridel, Kabuluan, Don Tomas, Guitol, Tabugon, Maualawin, Patag Ibaba and Patag Iraya..The boundary dispute originated from Act 2711 or the Revised Administrative Code which was enacted in 1917..Section 42 of Act 2711 defines the Tayabas-Camarines Norte boundary as:
Camarines Norte and Tayabas boundary..– The boundary separating the Province of Camarines Norte from the Province of Tayabas begins at a point on the eastern shore of Basiad Bay and extends to a peak known as Mount Cadig in such manner as to bring the territory of the barrio of Basiad entirely within the municipality of Capalonga, in Camarines Norte, and to exclude the same from the territory of Calauag, in Tayabas..From Mount Cadig it extends along the crest of a mountain range, a distance of 50 kilometers, more or less, to a peak known as Mount Labo; thence in a southwesterly direction, a distance of 25 kilometers, more or less, to a prominent stone monument at the source or headwaters of the Pasay River, thence along the meandering course of said river in a southerly direction, a distance of 1½ kilometers, more or less, to the Gulf of Ragay.
In 1922, the then Chief of the Executive Bureau, acted upon the authority of the Secretary of the Interior..This ruling by the then chief was never implemented even with repeated efforts of the provincial government of Camarines Norte and the Secretary of Interior..The Chief delineated the border as follows:
Starting from the peak of Mt..Labo as a common corner between the provinces of Tayabas, Camarines Sur and Camarines Norte thence a straight line is drawn to the peak of Mt..Cadig; thence a straight line is drawn to the point of intersection of the inter-provincial road between Camarines Norte and Tayabas with the Tabugon River; thence, following the course of the river to its mouth at Basiad Bay.
In the legal dispute, Quezon raised two points of contention..First is that Act 2711 already delineated the boundaries of the province..Second is that the Chief of the Executive Bureau had no power nor authority to change the boundaries of the province..Regarding the first issue, the court stated that it is true that Act 2711 delineated the boundary but it did not delineate the entirety of the boundary..The point on the eastern shore of Basiad Bay was never specifically located, thus, needing further delineation..On the second issue, the court stated that the Chief did not alter the borders in any way..The Chief worked with the requirement that the point be on the eastern shore of Basiad Bay..He was also acting on the consideration of Act 2809, the Act establishing Camarines Norte, which states that Camarines Norte be established with the borders it had before merging with Camarines Sur..The court then ruled in favor of Camarines Norte and ordered the provincial government of Quezon to transfer all its authority and jurisdiction to the former.
By 2001, the Provincial Government of Quezon, this time represented by Governor Eduardo Rodriguez, the Provincial Government of Camarines Norte, as represented by Governor Roy Padilla, went back to court..Even with the judgment on the 1989 case was executory by 1990, the provincial government of Quezon did not abide by the court's ruling..In 1991, a Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) technical team conducted a survey of the area and erected a monument marker to delineate the boundary of the area..However, by October 1991, Quezon Governor Eduardo Rodriguez and Calauag Mayor Julio Lim caused the removal of the marker..Throughout the proceedings, several government agencies including the Department of Budget and Management, Comelec, as well as the Philippine Statistics Authority recognized the jurisdiction of the town of Santa Elena, Camarines Norte over the 9 barangays..In 2000, Judge Regino held Governor Rodriguez and Mayor Lim guilty of contempt, with a maximum imprisonment of 6 months as well as a fine of ₱1,000 for the erection of a new boundary marker.
Failed proposal to divide Quezon
Main article: 2008 Quezon del Sur creation plebiscite
In 2007, Republic Act No..9495 proposed to further divide Quezon into Quezon del Norte and Quezon del Sur..Quezon del Norte was to be composed of the first and second congressional districts of the province (Burdeos, General Nakar, Infanta, Jomalig, Lucban, Mauban, Pagbilao, Panukulan, Patnanungan, Polilio, Real, Sampaloc, Tayabas, Candelaria, Dolores, San Antonio, Sariaya, Tiaong and Lucena), with Lucena as its capital..Quezon del Sur, with its capital at Gumaca, would have been composed of the third and fourth congressional districts (Agdangan, Buenavista, Catanauan, General Luna, Macalelon, Mulanay, Padre Burgos, Pitogo, San Andres, San Francisco, San Narciso, Unisan, Alabat, Atimonan, Calauag, Guinayangan, Gumaca, Lopez, Perez, Plaridel, Quezon and Tagkawayan)..The act lapsed into law without the signature of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on September 7, 2007.
As required by law, the COMELEC held a plebiscite on December 13, 2008, 60 days after law took effect..The majority of the votes cast overwhelmingly rejected the division, therefore the split did not push through.
Tayabas cityhood
The municipality of Tayabas became a component city by virtue of Republic Act No..9398 which sought to convert the municipality into a city..The law was ratified on July 14, 2007..However, the cityhood status was lost twice in the years 2008 and 2010 after the LCP questioned the validity of the cityhood law..The cityhood status was reaffirmed after the court finalized its ruling on February 15, 2011 which declared the cityhood law constitutional.
Geography

Physical characteristics
Quezon, east of Metro Manila, is the 8th largest province in the Philippines having an area of 8,989.39 square kilometers (3,470.82 sq mi)..The northern part of the province is sandwiched between the Sierra Madre mountain range and the Philippine Sea..The southern part consists of the Tayabas Isthmus, which separates the Bicol Peninsula from the main part of Luzon Island, and the Bondoc Peninsula which lies between Tayabas Bay and Ragay Gulf..Because of this, majority of towns in the province have access to the sea..The province is bounded by the provinces of Aurora, Bulacan, Rizal, Laguna, Batangas, Camarines Sur and Camarines Norte..It is bounded to the east by the Pacific Ocean and to the south by Tayabas Bay..The province is said to be characterized by a rugged terrain with patches of plains, valleys and swamps.
The major islands of Quezon are Alabat Island and Polillo Islands..Mount Banahaw, an active volcano, is the highest peak at 2,169 meters (7,116 ft).
The province has a total of 1,066.36 km (662.61 mi) of coastline However, due to rampant illegal logging as well as kaingin, these forests are constantly threatened.
Climate
Because of the sheer size of Quezon, different areas have different climate patterns..Most of the province falls under Type IV Climate which means that rains are evenly distributed throughout the year..Polillo, Infanta, and parts of Calauag fall under Type II climate which means that there are no dry seasons but there is a pronounced wet season from November to April..Parts of the western towns of Tiaong, San Antonio, Dolores, and Candelaria as well as the tip of Bondoc Peninsula including parts of Mulanay, San Francisco, San Narciso and San Andres fall under Type III climate..This means that there is a relatively dry season from November to April..Although these are the patterns observed, it is important to note that with climate change, these patterns have become more erratic..Typhoons have become stronger through the years, causing problems such as power outages, road blockages, landslides, flashfloods and crop damages.
Administrative divisions
Quezon comprises 39 municipalities and one component city (Tayabas), which are organized into four legislative districts and further subdivided into 1,209 barangays.
The capital, Lucena, is independent of the administrative and fiscal supervision of the province but is eligible to vote for provincial officials.

Beaches and springs
Sunrise in Real, Quezon
To the north, the island of Balesin (part of Polillo) has become playground to the rich and famous.
In the central portion of the province, the beaches of Guisguis in Sariaya have long been considered a local destination..Several resorts including Villa del Prado Resort, Dalampasigan Beach Resort and the Montevista Beach Resort are some of the resorts in the area.
In the south, the Bondoc Peninsula towns offer an array of resorts with good beaches such as the Municipalities of Agdangan, Unisan and Catanauan..The islands of Padre Burgos also showcase the “ Borawan Island “ with pure sand like Boracay and a scenic view like Palawan hence its name Borawan..While on the Lamon Bay Area of Quezon, the Island of Alabat (municipalities: Perez, Alabat, Quezon) offers countless beach resorts.
Mountains
Rugged terrains characterize the province's topography with few plains, valleys, and swamps..The Sierra Madre Mountain Range runs along the entire length of the area, with Mount Banahaw (an active volcano) rising at 2,169 meters above sea level..Only narrow strips of land along the coast and river valleys are available for growing crops..The undulating lowlands along the coast are well-drained..The province is narrow, averaging about thirty (30) kilometers by width.
Mount Banahaw is a pilgrimage site for some locals who believe the mountain to be holy..Although considered an active volcano, hiking has been popular with both religious pilgrims as well as hikers..There are two trails to the mountain, both originating from Barangay Kinabuhayan in the town of Dolores..The most frequently used trails are the Cristalino and Tatlong Tangke, taking an average of 9 and 5 hours, respectively but both converges at the volcano's summit..At the peak are viewpoints, labeled as Durungawan I, II, and III, which are the usual destination for pilgrims and hikers..However, due to pollution and trash left by these visitors, Mt..Banahaw was closed to the public until further notice.

Quirino, officially the Province of Quirino (Ilocano: Probinsia ti Quirino; Tagalog: Lalawigan ng Quirino), is a landlocked province in the Philippines located in the Cagayan Valley region in Luzon..Its capital is Cabarroguis..It is named after Elpidio Quirino, the sixth President of the Philippines.
The province borders Aurora to the southeast, Nueva Vizcaya to the west, and Isabela to the north..Quirino used to be part of the province of Nueva Vizcaya, until it was separated in 1966.
History
Early history
Long before its formal creation as an independent province, Quirino was the forest region of the province of Nueva Vizcaya, inhabited by tribal groups known as the Negritos..They roamed the hinterlands and built their huts at the heart of the jungle..Aside from the Negritos, the area was also inhabited by Ilongot people, who were feared for their headhunting raids against enemy tribes and Spanish-controlled settlements..Throughout the period of Spanish colonization, the province was one of the few remaining unconquered areas in the Philippines due to its remoteness, having only seen a Spanish military expedition in 1848 and the brief presence of Spanish missionaries in 1891.

Colonial era
During the American period, the territory of Quirino was administered by the province of Isabela before Congressman Leon Cabarroguis of Nueva Vizcaya pushed for its return to Nueva Vizcaya by authoring Republic Act No..236, which was signed into law in 1948.
Marcos dictatorship era
Main articles: Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos, Human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship, and Deforestation in the Philippines during the Marcos dictatorship
The beginning months of the 1970s marked a period of turmoil and change in the Philippines, as well as in the localities which would later become the Province of Quirino.
With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years.
When the 1986 snap election came along, Quirino was noted as the site of election related violence, with the murder of UNIDO opposition party organizers Francisco Laurella and Fernando Pastor Sr., and Pastor's son Fernando Pastor Sr.
The bright spot for the province was that the efforts of Quirino's legislators finally managed to see its establishment as a separate Province in February 1972.
Establishment as a separate Province
On June 18, 1966, Republic Act No..4734 was enacted, constituting the municipalities of Diffun, Saguday, Aglipay, and Maddela, all from Nueva Vizcaya province, into a new sub-province to be known as ""Quirino"", named after the late Philippine President Elpidio Quirino.
On June 21, 1969, Republic Act No..5554 was enacted, amending RA 4734, and creating the municipality of Cabarroguis (now the provincial capital town), which was taken from portions of Diffun, Saguday, and Aglipay.
Republic Act No..6394, authored by then-Congressman Leonardo B. Perez (Nueva Vizcaya–Lone), was passed on September 10, 1971, further amending RA 5554 and separating the sub-province of Quirino from its mother province, Nueva Vizcaya, constituting it into a regular province.
The province of Quirino was formally established on February 10, 1972, upon the assumption to office of the first elected provincial and municipal officials headed by Dionisio Sarandi as Provincial Governor.
On February 25, 1983, Batas Pambansa Blg..345 was enacted, creating within Quirino the municipality of Nagtipunan, a division of the municipality of Maddela.

Rizal, officially the Province of Rizal (Filipino: Lalawigan ng Rizal), is a province in the Philippines located in the Calabarzon region in Luzon..Its capital is the city of Antipolo..It is about 16 kilometers (9.9 mi) east of Manila..The province is named after José Rizal, one of the main national heroes of the Philippines..It is bordered by Metro Manila to the west, Bulacan to the north, Quezon to the east and Laguna to the southeast..The province also lies on the northern shores of Laguna de Bay, the largest lake in the country..Rizal is a mountainous province perched on the western slopes of the southern portion of the Sierra Madre mountain range.
Antipolo serves as the provincial capital since 2020, having been an administrative center since 2009 with the capitol located in the city..Previously, Pasig served as the capital, a designation it retained even after becoming part of the National Capital Region in 1975.
The province is a part of Greater Manila Area..It is the 5th largest province in the Philippines in terms of population.
History
Further information: Morong (district) and Manila (province)
Early history
Tagalog settlement arrived some time in the pre-Spanish period..The provincial territory began with the organization of the Tondo and Laguna provinces during the Spanish administration..Some of the towns like Pasig, Parañaque, Taytay and Cainta were already thriving.
Spanish colonial era
From the reports of the Encomiendas in 1582–1583, the Encomiendas of Moron (Morong) was under the jurisdiction of La Laguna and, the Encomiendas of Passi (Pasig), Taitay (Taytay) and Tagui (Taguig) belonged to the Province of Tondo..It was recorded that in 1591, the Encomiendas of Moron and Taitay were under the jurisdiction of the Franciscan Order in the Province of La Laguna; and the Encomiendas of Nabotas (Navotas), Tambobo (Malabon), Tondo, Parañaque (then La Huerta, Parañaque), Longalo (Don Galo, Parañaque), Tagui and Pasig were under the jurisdiction of the Augustinians in the Province of Tondo.
In 1853, a new political subdivision named Distrito Politico-Militar de los Montes de San Mateo (transl..Political-Military District of the San Mateo Mountains) was formed.
By virtue of Circular No..83, dated September 2, 1859, the Province of Tondo became the Province of Manila..All its towns were placed under the administration, fiscal supervision and control of the Governor of the new province.
The town of Mariquina (Marikina) became the capital of the Province of Manila during the tenure of the revolutionary government of Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo..The Politico-Military District of Morong had for its capital the town of Antipolo from 1898 to 1899 and the town of Tanay from 1899 to 1900.
American invasion era

On February 6, the First Philippine Commission sought to establish civil government in the country through a provincial organization act after the Filipino-Spanish and Filipino-American conflicts.
Therefore, on June 5, 1901, a historic meeting was held at the Pasig Catholic Church for the organization of a civil government in the Province of Manila and District of Morong, with 221 delegates in attendance..The first Philippine Commission, headed by William Howard Taft and composed of Commissioners Luke E. Wright, Henry C. Ide, Bernard Moses and Dean C. Worcester, discussed with the Assembly the issue of whether or not to write the Province of Manila with the District of Morong, was not self-sufficient to operate as a separate province.
Although the delegates from Morong, Hilarion Raymundo, and José Tupas, objected to the proposal, Juan Sumulong of Antipolo strongly advocated the move..After much acrimonious debate and upon the suggestion of Trinidad H. Pardo de Tavera the body agreed on the creation of a new province independent of the Province of Manila..The new province was aptly named after José Rizal, the country's national hero.
The ruins of the first provincial capitol in barangay Santa Rosa, Pasig was the seat of government for the province until 1950.
On June 11, 1901, the province of Rizal was officially and legally created by virtue of Act No..137 by the First Philippine Commission which during the time was acting as the unicameral legislative body in the island of Luzon.
The new province was composed of 32 municipalities, 19 from the old Province of Manila (i.e..Cainta, Caloocan, Las Piñas, Malibay, Mariquina (Marikina), Montalban (Rodriguez), Muntinlupa, Navotas, Novaliches, Parañaque, Pasig, Pateros, Pineda (Pasay), San Felipe Neri (Mandaluyong), San Juan del Monte (San Juan), San Mateo, San Pedro Macati (Makati), Taguig, Tambobong (Malabon)); and 13 from the Politico-Military District of Morong (i.e..Angono, Antipolo, Baras, Binangonan, Bosoboso, Cardona, Jalajala, Morong, Pililla, Quisao, Tanay, Taytay and Teresa).
The number of municipalities changed with the municipal boundaries through time, mostly occurring within the provincial boundary.
Political map of Rizal before the creation of Quezon City
On October 12, 1939, Quezon City was established, which included parts of Caloocan, and later on, Novaliches and parts of Marikina, Pasig and San Juan.
Japanese occupation era
Marking's and the Hunter's ROTC Guerrillas operated in Rizal Province throughout the war.
In 1942, Quezon City and the towns of Caloocan, Makati, Mandaluyong, Parañaque, Pasay, and San Juan were merged with Manila to form the City of Greater Manila, by virtue of Executive Order No..400 signed by President Manuel L. Quezon as an emergency measure.
Philippine independence
The second provincial capitol along Shaw Boulevard, Pasig was the seat of government for the province from 1950 to 2009..It was demolished in 2010 and the site was rebuilt as Capitol Commons.
Through Presidential Decree No..824, Rizal was partitioned on November 7, 1975 to form Metropolitan Manila..The municipalities of Las Piñas, Parañaque, Muntinlupa, Taguig, Pateros, Makati, Mandaluyong, San Juan, Malabon, Navotas, Pasig and Marikina, and the three cities of Caloocan, Pasay and Quezon City were excised to form the new region, while the other 14 towns remained in Rizal.
Contemporary
On June 17, 2008, Governor Casimiro Ynares III announced the transfer of the provincial capitol from Pasig to Antipolo..The new ₱270-million capitol building, constructed by Ortigas & Co., owner thereof, was completed by December of that year..Built on a 5-hectare (12-acre) lot near the Ynares Center, it was successfully inaugurated on March 4, 2009, bringing back the Capitol Building inside the provincial territory from which it was absent for 34 years (when Pasig was incorporated into Metro Manila).
On June 19, 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Republic Act No..11475 into law, which officially transferred the capital of the Rizal province from Pasig to Antipolo..The law was published on June 22, 2020, and took effect on July 7, 2020..The publication of the law coincided with the 159th birth anniversary of Rizal.
Geography
Rizal covers a total area of 1,182.65 square kilometers (456.62 sq mi) occupying the northern-central section of the Calabarzon in Luzon..The province is bordered on the north by Bulacan, east by Quezon, southeast by Laguna, south by Laguna de Bay, and west by Metro Manila.
Located 20 kilometers (12 mi) east of Manila, commuters take approximately an hour to reach the provincial seat which is in Antipolo..Generally hilly and mountainous in terrain, most of the province's southern towns lie in the shores of Laguna de Bay, the country's largest inland body of water.
Talim Island, the largest island situated within Laguna de Bay, is under the jurisdiction of the province and shared by the municipalities of Binangonan and Cardona.

Romblon (/rɒmˈbloʊn/ rom-BLOHN, Tagalog:
Romblon has been inhabited by aboriginal Filipinos prior to the arrival of the Spanish in 1569..Archaeological artifacts recovered by the National Museum in 1936 indicate that the aborigines of Romblon already have a rich and advanced culture..During the Spanish colonial rule, Romblon was initially administered under the province of Arevalo (Iloilo) until 1716, when it was transferred to the jurisdiction of the newly created province of Capiz..With arrival of the Americans in 1901, Romblon was declared a province and placed under civilian rule..It lost its provincial status for a short while between 1907 and 1945, but regained it in 1946, just after World War II.
The inhabitants of Romblon are divided into three ethnolinguistic groups: Romblomanon, Onhan and Asi..These groups occupy specific islands in the province and have their own language and customs..Romblomanon is mainly spoken in the town of Romblon, in all of three towns of Sibuyan Island, and the town of San Agustin in Tablas..Onhan is mainly spoken in the municipalities in the southern part of Tablas (Alcantara, Looc, Ferrol, Santa Fe, San Andres, and Santa Maria), as well as in the island municipality of San Jose..The northwestern part of Tablas Island (in Odiongan and Calatrava, as well as the islands municipalities of Corcuera, Banton, and Concepcion), speaks the Asi language.
The province relies on agriculture, particularly rice and copra farming as well as fishing, for its livelihood..It also has a lucrative marble industry due to an abundance of Italian-quality marble, hence, its moniker as the ""Marble Capital of the Philippines.""
Etymology
According to legend, the name ""Romblon"" was derived from the Romblomanon word Nagalumyom, which pertains to a chicken in the act of sitting on its eggs on a nest.
Meanwhile, local historians Roland Madeja and Evelyn Reyes relate the origin of the name ""Romblon"" to the shape of Romblon Island..Madeja claims that the name was derived from the Spanish word ronblon, another term for tornillo, meaning ""screw."".According to him, the Spanish claimed to have observed the screw-like shape of Romblon Island.

Early history
Romblon's aboriginal inhabitants were the Negritos from Panay and Mangyans from Mindoro, who settled in the islands during the precolonial period.
Spanish colonial era

According to historians Emma Helen Blair and James Alexander Robertson, the Spanish arrived in Romblon in 1569 led by conquistador Martin de Goiti who was dispatched by Miguel López de Legazpi to explore the western and northern portion of the Visayas region including Romblon and Mindoro..The islands were later organized into three encomiendas and were administered from Arevalo..De Loarca visited Romblon in 1582 and conducted the first census of the islands.
In 1635, Augustinian Recollect missionaries arrived in Romblon to establish Catholic missions and settlements..They helped the Spanish authorities establish peace and order in the islands..In 1868, they established seven missionary centers at Romblon, Badajoz (San Agustin), Cajidiocan, Banton, Looc, Odiongan and Magallanes (Magdiwang)..They also built massive forts, churches and watchtowers in the province, such as Fort San Jose in Banton and Fort San Andres in Romblon, following a Dutch attack in 1646 which destroyed the capital town and to repulse recurring Moro raids.
Romblon was separated from the jurisdiction of Arevalo and annexed to Capiz, when the province was created in 1716..More than a century later in 1850, the inhabitants of the province began using Spanish family names after governor-general Narciso Clavería decreed on 21 November 1849 the use of surnames from the Catálogo alfabético de apellidos..Asi-speaking natives were assigned the letter F, Romblomanon speakers were assigned the letter M, speakers of the Sibuyanon style of Romblomanon were assigned the letter R, while Onhan-speaking natives were assigned the letter G.
In 1853, the islands were organized into a politico-military comandancia (""sub-province"" in English) administered from Capiz and continued to be so until the end of the Spanish rule in 1898.
Philippine revolution
In 1898, amid the Philippine Revolution, Katipunan leader Emilio Aguinaldo sent his generals to several provinces in the Visayas to expand the recognition of his revolutionary government in the central and southern Philippines.
Later, Don Wenceslao Molo, a local from Romblon town, was appointed governor and became responsible for the collection of a total amount of ₱22,765.21, Romblon's share to the war expenditures of the Revolutionary Government from 31 May 1898 to 28 February 1899..A local election was also held in Romblon town for its ministers of justice and barrio officials.
American colonial era

Upon the restoration of peace and order in the province following the Philippine–American War, the Americans established civilian government in the islands on 16 March 1901..Romblon was created as a regular province in the same year but due to insufficient income, it became a sub-province of Capiz again from 15 July 1907 until 22 February 1918,
Japanese occupation era
During World War II, the Japanese Imperial Forces established a garrison in Romblon on 21 March 1942 which they maintained until the end of the war..The islands became one of the centers of resistance movement against the Japanese..The movement was led by the Free Panay Guerilla Forces composed of members from the 6th Military District under the direction of Col. Macario Peralta, Jr.
Philippine independence
On July 4, 1946, the United States relinquished sovereignty over the Philippines and recognized the Republic of the Philippines as a sovereign and independent nation with the signing of the Treaty of General Relations and Protocol by representatives of the United States and Republic of the Philippines.
On 1 October 1946, Congress passed Republic Act No..38, sponsored by Cong..Modesto Formilleza, which abolished the four special municipalities and restored Romblon and its municipalities to its pre-war status.
Romblon, which is historically and geographically part of the Western Visayas Region, is made politically part of the Southern Tagalog Region (Region IV) in the gerrymandering of the Philippines by Ferdinand Marcos on 1972..When Southern Tagalog was divided into Calabarzon and Mimaropa, upon the issuance of Executive Order No..103 by then-President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo dated May 17, 2002, Romblon was made part of Mimaropa, officially Southwestern Tagalog Region.
Geography
Macat-ang Beach in Banton
Romblon is strategically situated at the center of the Philippine archipelago..Geographically part of the Visayas, it is composed of three major islands (Tablas, Sibuyan and Romblon) and 17 smaller islands..It is surrounded by deep waters, and is bounded by Masbate in the east, Mindoro in the west, Marinduque in the north and Panay in the south..It is approximately 187 nautical miles (346 km) and 169 miles (272 km) south of Manila..The islands are dispersed and accessible only via sea transportation except for Tablas Island where a domestic airport is located in the municipality of Alcantara.
Topography
The province has a total land area of approximately 1,533.45 square kilometers (592 sq mi) representing about 5.3 percent of the total land area of Region IV-B Mimaropa..It is generally mountainous with about 40 percent of its land area having an inclination of more than 50 percent..Only four percent of the total area has an inclination of three to eight percent, while a sparse 10 percent has an inclination of three to zero percent..Narrow strips of coastal lowlands, low hills and plains typify the topography of some of the islands.
Romblon Island is hilly with a maximum elevation of about 400 meters (1,300 ft) above sea level..Tablas Island shows varied relief characteristics..The western coastal areas are level to undulating while the eastern coastal areas are rough to rugged..The southern section covering Santa Fe and the mid-western portion may be described as having rolling to rough terrain..Extremely rugged areas can be found in the central section of the island..The highest elevation is almost 500 meters (1,600 ft) above sea level..Sibuyan Island is a thickly forested mountain mass..The western portion of the island may be characterized as extensively rugged, having ascents of 60 percent or more while the eastern section is relatively undulating to rolling..The highest elevation, the peak of Mt..Guiting-Guiting, reaches about 2,058 meters (6,750 feet) above sea level.
The major areas that are highly productive and buildable are basically in Tablas and Sibuyan..These include Odiongan, San Andres, Looc and Santa Fe in Tablas Island..All three municipalities in Sibuyan Island, on the other hand, have substantial level to gently sloping lands..Overall, good developable lands represent about 13 percent of the province's total area.
Flora and fauna
Romblon, particularly Sibuyan Island, is among the few places in the Philippines with a well-preserved natural environment..Uninterrupted rainforest covers 75 percent of the island..It is also home to the country's cleanest inland body of water, the Cantigas River, as well as 34 waterfalls.
Administrative divisions
Romblon comprises 17 municipalities..Of these, nine are located in Tablas Island (San Agustin, Calatrava, San Andres, Odiongan, Ferrol, Santa Fe, Looc, Alcantara and Santa Maria), three in Sibuyan Island (Magdiwang, Cajidiocan and San Fernando) and five (Romblon, San Jose, Banton, Concepcion and Corcuera) are island municipalities.

The languages of Romblon, as well as all languages native to the Philippines, belong to the Austronesian language family, the second largest language family in the world with 1,257 known languages, second only to the Niger–Congo family's 1,538 languages..All of the languages of the Philippines, except Samalan, are classified as Philippine languages under the Western Malayo-Polynesian branch of Austronesian..The Philippine language group has three main branches: Northern, Southern and Central, the latter of which is composed of the Bisayan, Bikol and Tagalog languages.
Unlike other islands or provinces in the Philippines where all local languages are classifiable under the same subgroup of languages, each of the three languages of Romblon — Romblomanon, Onhan and Asi — actually belongs to a different subgroup of the Visayan language group..Romblomanon belongs to the Central Visayan subgroup, which spans from Waray-Waray in Samar and Leyte, through Masbatenyo and Sorsoganon, and as far west as Hiligaynon and Capiznon on Panay..It is spoken in Romblon and Sibuyan Islands, as well as in the municipality of San Agustin in Tablas Island.
Onhan, on the other hand, belongs to the Western Visayan subgroup, which includes Kinaray-a and Aklanon, as well as several minor languages spoken on Mindoro, Palawan, and some small islands in between..Its speakers are mainly from the southern portion of Tablas Island, in the municipalities of San Andres, Santa Maria, Alcantara, Ferrol, Looc, and Santa Fe, as well as in the municipality of San Jose in Carabao Island..Hiligaynon is spoken in municipalities near Capiz and Aklan..As Romblon is part of Mimaropa which is also known as Southwestern Tagalog Region, provincial settlers speak Tagalog/Filipino as lingua franca between different Visayan languages.
Religion
Cathedral of St. Vincent Ferrer of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente in Odiongan.
The people of the province are predominantly Roman Catholic..In 2012, the UP School of Economics reported that 75 percent of households were Catholic (Roman Catholic and Iglesia Filipina Independiente combined), 9 percent were Muslim and 3-5 percent belonged to Iglesia ni Cristo.

Romblon used to be one of the poorest provinces in the Philippines until 2015 when it recorded lower poverty incidence of 38.63 percent, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority..Poverty incidence in the province further declined to 28.28 percent in 2018..The provincial economy is heavily reliant on agriculture, tourism and mineral extraction which can be greatly affected by typhoons the frequently pass through the province yearly.
Agriculture
Agriculture is the main industry in Romblon..Coconut is the most cultivated crop with a total planted area of 58,270.44 hectares (224.9834 sq mi)..San Agustin has the most extensive area with coconut plants followed by Romblon and Cajidiocan..Rice is the next crop, cultivated particularly in Odiongan, Looc, Cajidiocan and Santa Fe..Other crops grown include root crops, vegetables and fruits..Odiongan, Banton and Magdiwang have the greatest areas planted with root crops and correspondingly, have the highest volume of production..Vegetable production is mostly for home consumption and grown in small scale.
Fisherfolk in Romblon unload the day's catch from their nets.
Livestock development and poultry production is a viable small scale enterprise for farmers in the province..The provincial government maintains breeding facilities in strategic locations province-wide to encourage farmers to engage in livestock and poultry production to augment their income..Livestock and poultry management training and seminars is provided to interested clients.
Due to the geographical condition of the province, crops and livestock production is generally deficient as compared to the food requirements of Romblon population..To meet the rice requirements, Romblon relies on imports from the neighboring provinces while vegetables, poultry meat, vegetables and fruits are supplied mostly by Luzon.
Marine resources
Fishing industry is a major enterprise as Romblon is surrounded by water on all sides..The fishing grounds of Romblon are a migratory path of fish from Sulu and Visayan Seas passing Tablas Strait, Sibuyan Sea and Romblon Pass..The waters also abound with demersal fish due to the coral reefs surrounding the islands.
Because the province has a great potential for aqua-marine development, the province implemented a coastal and resource management program..Each municipality established a fish sanctuary and passed laws on fishery..The use of air compressors in the municipal waters was regulated and banned altogether in some municipalities.
Mineral resources
Marble wares from RomblonMarble plant workers working in a quarry.
Marble is the most significant mineral deposit of Romblon and is the most renowned product of the province..Based on statistics, Romblon is the second biggest provincial marble producer of the country next to Bulacan..Romblon marble is of very high quality and comes in shades of white, green, pink, red and black..The Mines and Geosciences Bureau has estimated that Romblon is endowed with about 150 million metric tons of marble..At current rates of extraction, the supply may last for three more centuries..Tablas Island is also believed to have vast reserves of marble.
Marble quarrying and processing are major activities in Romblon..Among the most common marble products are categorized into the following: novelty items (gifts, ashtray, table bars), furniture (dining tables, baptismal fonts) and construction materials (tiles, balusters, marble chips)..Other mineral resources with considerable quantity include nickel ore and gold mostly to be found in Sibuyan Island..Gold panning and small-scale mining is a lucrative undertaking in Magdiwang.

Mount Guiting-Guiting in Sibuyan, the province's tallest mountain, is considered one of the most difficult climbs in the Philippines, and is thus a major destination of local mountain climbers because of its steep and jagged summit.
Mainit Falls in Odiongan
Heritage sites
Aside from the precolonial Guyangan Cave System in Banton, the province also has several heritage sites built during the Spanish colonial period..In Romblon town, the forts of San Andres and Santiago served as fortifications against Muslim pirates in the 17th century, while the St. Joseph Cathedral and Belfry houses a centuries-old image of the Santo Niño de Cebú or the Holy Child.
Festivals
Every second week of January, Romblon town celebrates the feast of the Santo Niño de Cebú, also known as the Biniray Festival.
Scuba diving
In recent years Romblon Island has attracted more scuba divers..It has pristine and untouched reefs with almost undisturbed hard and soft corals around the islands of Romblon, Logbon, Alad and Cobrador..With multiple marine sanctuaries and private associations most of the marine life around Romblon is protected..In addition to the reefs, Romblon has been becoming famous for its rare and unique macro habitat, such as the Melibe colemani, the Cyerce nigra and the Cyerce bourbonica.

Samar, officially the Province of Samar (Waray: Probinsya han Samar; Tagalog: Lalawigan ng Samar), formerly named Western Samar, is a province in the Philippines located in the Eastern Visayas region..Its capital is the city of Catbalogan..It is bordered by Northern Samar, Eastern Samar, Leyte and Leyte Gulf, and includes several islands in the Samar Sea..Samar is connected to the island of Leyte via the San Juanico Bridge.
In 1768, Leyte and modern Samar were created out of the historical province of Samar..In 1965, Northern and Eastern Samar were created.
Fishing and agriculture are the major economic activities in the province.
On 8 November 2013, the province was significantly damaged by Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan), particularly the towns of Basey, Marabut and Santa Rita.
Etymology
Samar is said to derive from the word Samad, a Visayan word for ""wound"" or ""cut"", describing the rough physical features of the land which is rugged and deeply dissected by streams.
History
Pre-history
Around 2 million to 8000 B.C, based on geologic findings, during the ice ages (2 million years – 8000 B.C), the islands of Mindoro, Luzon, and Mindanao were connected as one big island through the islands of Samar, Leyte and Bohol.
Early history
In 8550 B.C., diggings in Sohoton Caves in Basey, Samar showed stone flake tools..In 1200 A.D., other diggings along the Basey River revealed other stone flakes used until the 13th century.
Spanish colonial era
In 1543, the explorer Ruy López de Villalobos, first came to the island and named it Las Islas Filipinas.
In 1596, many names (such as Samal, Ibabao, Tandaya) were given to Samar Island prior to the coming of the Spaniards in 1596..The name ""Samar"" was derived from the local language samad, meaning ""wound"" or ""cut"", aptly describing the rough physical features of the island, rugged and deeply dissected by streams..During the early days of Spanish occupation, Samar was under the jurisdiction of Cebu.
On October 15, 1596, the first Jesuit missionaries arrived in Tinago (now Dapdap) in Tarangnan..From Tinago, the missionaries, Fr..Francisco de Otazo, Bartolome Martes and Domingo Alonzo began teaching Catechism, healing the sick and spreading the Christian faith into the interior settlements.
On June 1, 1649, the people of Palapag led by Agustin Sumuroy revolted against the decree of Governor General Diego Fajardo requiring able bodied men from the Visayas for service at the Cavite Shipyards..Like wildfire, the revolt quickly spread to the neighboring town in the Northern and Western coast of Samar and to the nearby provinces of Bicol, Surigao, Cebu, Camiguin and as far as Zamboanga..It was suppressed in 1650 by the combined forces of the Spaniards, Lutaos, and Pampangos.
In 1735, Samar and Leyte were united into one province with Carigara, in Leyte, as the capital town.
In 1747, Samar and Leyte were separated for administrative effectiveness.
In 1762, complaints from the Jesuits that the division was not working well, thus it was reunited again by the approval from the King of Spain.
In 1768, Jesuits were expelled in all Spanish dominions..The Franciscans arrived on September 25, 1768, and took over the administration of 14 of the 17 parishes which were under the spiritual care of the Jesuits for almost 172 years..The administration of the remaining three parishes namely Guiuan, Balangiga and Basey in the south of Samar were given to the Augustinians.
In 1777, the two provinces were divided for the last time, it was approved in Madrid in 1786 and had been effective in 1799.
In 1803, Guiuan, Balangiga and Basey were turned over to the Franciscans for the lack of Augustinian priests.
On August 11, 1841, Queen Isabella II of Spain signed a Royal Decree declaring Samar as a province.
American invasion era
The Battle of Catubig occurred on April 15–18, 1900 during the Philippine–American War.
On April 15, 1900, the Filipino guerrillas launched a surprise attack on a detachment of the US 43rd Infantry Regiment, forcing the Americans to abandon Catubig town after the four-day siege.
In 1901, the Balangiga massacre occurred during the Philippine–American War.
On September 28, 1901, the people of Balangiga, Giporlos, Lawaan and Quinapondan in Eastern Samar surprised and attacked the American forces stationed there, killing 48 American soldiers..To avenge their defeat, American general Jacob H. Smith ordered his men to turn Samar into a ""howling wilderness"".
On April 10, 1910, upon the papal bull of Pope Pius X separated the islands of Samar and Leyte from the Diocese of Cebu and erected the Diocese of Calbayog comprising both islands..Pablo Singzon de Anunciacion was named first Bishop and consecrated on June 12, 1910.
Japanese occupation era
In 1942, the occupying Imperial Japanese forces arrived in the province of Samar.
On October 24, 1944, the Battle off Samar took place as Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita's Center Force warships clashed with several allied naval vessels in a collision course..His forces sank escort carrier USS Gambier Bay (CVE-73), destroyers USS Hoel (DD-533) and USS Johnston (DD-557), and escort destroyer USS Samuel B. Roberts (DE-413), but at a cost of his cruisers Chikuma, Chokai, and Suzuya..Despite being a tactical victory for the Imperial Japanese Navy, it did not alter the course of the Philippines campaign.
Philippine independence
On June 19, 1965, the Philippine Congress along with the three Samar Representatives, Eladio T. Balite (1st District), Fernando R. Veloso (2nd District) and Felipe J. Abrigo (3rd District), approved Republic Act No..4221 dividing the region of Samar into three divisions: Northern Samar, Eastern Samar, and Western Samar..Each region adopted a new capital: Catbalogan (Western Samar), Borongan (Eastern Samar), and Catarman (Northern Samar).
On June 21, 1969, under Republic Act No..5650, Western Samar was renamed Samar with Catbalogan still as the capital.
Contemporary
The capital town Catbalogan became a component city by virtue of Republic Act No..9391 which sought to convert the municipality into a city..The law was ratified on June 16, 2007..However, the cityhood status was lost twice in the years 2008 and 2010 after the LCP questioned the validity of the cityhood law..The cityhood status was reaffirmed after the court finalized its ruling on February 15, 2011 which declared the cityhood law constitutional.
On November 8, 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, locally known as Typhoon Yolanda hit Samar province.
In June 2018, a friendly fire incident happened between Philippine National Police and the Armed Forces of the Philippines under the administration of Rodrigo Duterte..The incident led to the death of numerous police officials of Waray ethnic origin.
On January 22, 2019, House Bill No..8824 was introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Edgar Mary Sarmiento to establish a new province called ""Northwest Samar"", consisting of nine municipalities and one city of Samar's 1st congressional district, of which Calbayog would be the designated capital..The bill is yet to be reviewed.
Geography
Samar province covers a total area of 6,048.03 square kilometres (2,335.16 sq mi) occupying the central-western sections of the Samar island in the Eastern Visayas region..The province is bordered on the north by Northern Samar, east by Eastern Samar, south by Leyte and Leyte Gulf, and west by the Samar Sea.
Topography
Karst islets off the coast of Marabut, southern Samar.
Samar province is hilly, with mountain peaks ranging from 200 to 800 metres (660 to 2,620 ft) high and narrow strips of lowlands, which tend to lie in coastal peripheries or in the alluvial plains and deltas accompanying large rivers..The largest lowlands are located along the northern coast extending up to the valleys of Catubig and Catarman rivers..Smaller lowlands in Samar are to be found in the Calbayog area and on the deltas and small valleys of Gandara and Ulot rivers..Slopes are generally steep and barren of trees due to deforestation..Run-off waters after heavy rains can provoke flooding in low-lying areas and the erosion of the mountains enlarges the coastal plains of the province.
Climate and rainfall
Areas near the eastern coast of the province have no dry season (with a pronounced maximum rain period usually occurring from December to January), and are thus open to the northeast monsoon..Municipalities in the southeastern section of the province experience this type of climate.
Areas located in the northwestern portion of the province have a more or less evenly distributed rainfall throughout the year.
Administrative divisions
The province of Samar comprises two congressional districts, 24 municipalities and two component cities..It has a total of 952 barangays.

Siquijor (/ˌsɪkiˈhɔːr/ SIK-ee-HOR, Tagalog:  located within the Negros Island Region..Its capital is the municipality of Siquijor, Siquijor..The province lies south of Cebu, southeast of Negros Oriental, southwest of Bohol, and north of Mindanao.
During the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines, the Spaniards called Siquijor the Isla del Fuego (Island of Fire), likely a reference to the island's location along the Pacific Ring of Fire.
Etymology
One popular legend says the name ""Siquijor"" comes from the famed pre-Spanish ruler of the island, King Datu Kihod.
Another legend says that a priest who visited the island said to the people, in Bohol, ""sequor,"" meaning ""to follow the waves""; the people misheard this, and assumed the island's name to be Siquijor.
Siquijor may have also come from the native word quidjod, meaning ""the tide is going out"".
History
Early history
According to legend, Siquijor was formed from the sea by a storm and an earthquake in the Visayan region..In modern times, highland farmers have found giant seashells underneath their farm plots to support this legend.
Prior to colonization, Siquijor was home to the Kedatuan of Katugasan, named after the tugas, the molave trees which abounded the island..The native dwellers of the island used these trees to build posts (haligi) for their houses because of their strength and durability that could withstand strong typhoons and monsoons..Most of the patriarchs of the island used the tugas to make a wooden plow (tukod) to cultivate the rocky soil for farming using mainly male cattle (toro) to pull it through the sticky and hard rocky soil..However, before the discovery of using tugas as the foundations of their houses, the island natives dwelt in caves as shown by the pottery and old tools like stone grinder excavated from the three caves of Sam-ang.
During this time, the people of the kingdom were already in contact with Chinese traders, as seen through archaeological evidence including Chinese ceramics and other objects..The art of traditional healing and traditional witchcraft belief systems also developed within this period.
Spanish occupation
The island was first sighted by the Spaniards in 1565 during Miguel López de Legazpi's expedition..The Spaniards called the island Isla del Fuego (""Island of Fire""), because the island gave off an eerie glow, from the great swarms of fireflies that lived in the numerous molave trees on the island..Esteban Rodríguez of the Legazpi expedition led the first Spaniards to discover the island..He was captain of a small party that left Legazpi's camp in Bohol to explore the nearby islands which are now called Pamilacan, Siquijor, and Negros.
The island, along with the rest of the archipelago, was subsequently annexed to the Spanish Empire..Founded in 1783 under the administration of secular clergymen, Siquijor became the first municipality as well as the first parish to be established on the island..Siquijor was, from the beginning, administered by the Diocese of Cebu..As for civil administration, Siquijor was under Bohol since the province had its own governor..The first Augustinian Recollect priest arrived in Siquijor in 1794..Several years later, a priest of the same order founded the parishes of Larena (initially called Can‑oan), Lazi (formerly Tigbawan), San Juan (Makalipay), and Maria (Cang‑meniao)..With the exception of Enrique Villanueva, the other five municipalities were established as parishes in 1877..From 1854 to 1892, Siquijor was administered by the politico-military province of Bohol..Later in 1892, it was transferred to Negros Oriental and became its sub-province in 1901.
American occupation
At the turn of the century, Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States of America with the Treaty of Paris that ended the Spanish–American War..Siquijor Island felt the presence of American rule when a unit of the American Cavalry Division came and stayed for some time..The American Military Governor in Manila appointed James Fugate, a scout with the California Volunteers of the U.S. Infantry, to oversee and implement the organization and development programs in Siquijor Island..Governor Fugate stayed for 16 years as lieutenant governor of Siquijor.
Japanese occupation
While it was not at the center of military action, Siquijor was not spared by World War II..Imperial Japanese detachments occupied the island between 1942 and 1943, announcing their arrival on the island with heavy shelling..At the outbreak of the war, Siquijor was a sub-province of Negros Oriental, headed by Lieutenant Governor Nicolas Parami..Refusing to pledge allegiance to the Japanese forces, Parami was taken by Japanese soldiers from his residence at Poo, Lazi one evening and brought to the military headquarters in Larena..He was never heard from again..On November 10, 1942, Japanese warships started shelling Lazi from Cang‑abas Point..In Lazi, a garrison was established in the old Home Economics Building of the Central School..Filipino guerrillas engaged in sabotage and the interaction during this time caused havoc on the Japanese lives and properties.
During this period, Siquijor was briefly governed by Shunzo Suzuki, a Japanese civilian appointed by the Japanese forces until he was assassinated in October 1942 by the guerrilla forces led by Iluminado Jumawanin, of Caipilan, Siquijor..Mamor Fukuda took control of Siquijor from June 1943 until the Japanese forces abandoned the island when the liberation forces came in 1944..In 1943, the Japanese puppet government appointed Sebastian Monera of San Juan as Governor of Siquijor..His administration, however, was cut short when he was executed, presumably by Filipino guerrillas operating in the mountains of Siquijor.
On September 30, 1943, the United States submarine USS Bowfin (SS-287) delivered supplies to the people of Siquijor and evacuated people from the island.
In mid-1945, local Filipino soldiers and officers under the 7th, 75th, and 76th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army arrived, and alongside recognized guerrilla fighter groups, liberated Siquijor.
Philippine independence
St. Isidore the Laborer Church
For a time Siquijor was a subprovince of Negros Oriental, but it became an independent province on September 17, 1971, under Republic Act 6398..The move was supported by the people of Siquijor as they have a distinct culture from those of Negros Oriental, while Marcos used the movement as a means to secure support from the people of the island to pave martial law acceptance the following year.
Contemporary
In 2006, the Lazi Church was added by the government as an extension to the Baroque Churches of the Philippines UNESCO World Heritage Site..The inscription of the church has been pending since.
In 2024, Siquijor was transferred from the Central Visayas Region to the Negros Island Region following the signing of Republic Act No..12000 by President Bongbong Marcos.

Tourism
Siquijor has long been associated with pre-Spanish traditions centered around self-help, mysticism, shamanism, and natural healing rituals, something the island's growing tourism industry thoroughly capitalizes on; for example, there is the ""Healing and Wellness Tour"", an officially-guided ceremony and experience for (paying) visitors to experience ancient meditative and cleansing procedures, ridding themselves of negative energies..Despite any negative reviews, the experience is reportedly harmless, and simply involves the application of herbs, with smoke and incense being burned, while meditating and being guided by a shamanic healer..There are also a number of other options for spiritual retreats for wealthy tourists looking to ""escape"" from the day-to-day, or to purify themselves of negativity in a non-medical, non-mainstream way.
Nonetheless, official signage is placed around the island, upon which a portrait of the governor is seen, assuring visitors that ""magic"" and ""witchcraft"" does not exist, nor has it ever existed, on Soquijor..It is reported that certain elderly or superstitious individuals, even to this day, view the island as cursed and will not set foot there or utter its name for fear of bad luck..The island's enduring reputation as a site of pre-colonial ""magic"" and ""sorcery"" has attracted its fair share of interested visitors, and also has earned it the scorn and condemnation of others, primarily very religious (Catholic and other Christian) groups, who view self-help and ""natural"" healing to be ""blasphemous"", as it may be seen as a human attempt to ""become"" or imitate the works of God.
Besides the mystical attractions, nature abounds on Siquijor, and the many ecological and geographical attractions include pristine beaches, waterfalls, coral reef diving, caves, plant and animal life.
Transportation
Siquijor has two public seaports: the Port of Siquijor and the Port of Larena..These seaports are capable of servicing cargo and passenger seacrafts daily..Destinations include Dumaguete in Negros Oriental, Tagbilaran in Bohol, Cebu City, and Plaridel in Misamis Occidental.
Siquijor also has an airfield, Siquijor Airport, located near Siquijor capable of handling smaller and mostly privately-owned airplanes..It does not serve commercial flights.

History
This section needs expansion..You can help by adding to it..(April 2016)
Spanish colonial era
In 1570 two Augustinian friars, Alonzon Jiménez and Juan Orta, accompanied by a certain captain, Enrique de Guzmán, reached Hibalong, a small fishing village near the mouth of Ginangra River, and planted the cross and erected the first chapel in Luzon..It was from this village that Ibalong, referring to the whole region, came to be..Moving inland with a northwesterly direction they passed by the territory now known as Pilar, before they reached Camalig, Albay..The establishment of the Abucay-Catamlangan Mission later was ample proof of this..The early towns established here were: Gibalon in 1570 (now sitio of Magallanes); Casiguran – 1600; Bulusan – 1631; Pilar – 1635; Donsol – 1668; Bacon - 1754; Gubat - 1764; Juban and Matnog – 1800; Bulan – 1801; Castilla – 1827; Magallanes – 1860; Sorsogon – 1866 and Irosin – 1880..The province was eventually separated from Albay on October 17, 1894, and adopted the name Sorsogon..The town of Sorsogon was also selected as its capital.
American invasion era
At the 1935 Philippine Constitutional Convention, Sorsogon had its own delegates..They were Adolfo Grafilo, Francisco Arellano, José S. Reyes, and Mario Gaurino.
During the Marcos dictatorship
Main articles: Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos and Human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship
The Philippines' gradual postwar recovery took a turn for the worse in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis being one of the early landmark events.
During this time, many citizens of Sorsogon joined the effort to resist the erosion of democracy, and many of them became political detainees, or were tortured and killed by the dictatorship's forces.
Contemporary
In 2000, Sorsogon City was created through the merging of the municipalities of Bacon and Sorsogon.

Languages
See also: Sorsogon languages and Bisakol languages
The Bicolano language is predominantly used in Sorsogon as the language used by its people..Despite this, Bicolano itself, as used in the province, has many peculiarities..What is known as ""Bikol Naga"" is generally used in written communications and generally understood there as a spoken language..However, the people who live in the southernmost parts of Sorsogon like Gubat speak the Waray language..In either case, English and Filipino are the official languages used in education and government communication.
The Bikol languages are peculiar in some localities..For example, people in Bacon, Prieto Diaz and Magallanes speak the Albay Bikol variant..In Sorsogon City, Casiguran and Juban, Bicolano is different for some terms being used there, which have similarity to the Hiligaynon language (the language spoken in Western Visayas and southwestern Masbate).
In Barcelona, Gubat, Bulusan, Matnog, Irosin and Santa Magdalena, a dialect is spoken in which terms and tones are similar to the Waray language of Eastern Visayas (particularly in Northern Samar) called Waray Sorsogon language..The people of Pilar and Donsol speak a dialect which is similar, but not exactly, to the ""Miraya Bicol"" or the dialect spoken by the nearby towns of Camalig and Daraga in Albay province..The Castilla dialect, although distinct, has a similarity to that which is spoken in Daraga.
Sorsogon Ayta Language
In 2010, UNESCO released its 3rd world volume of Endangered Languages in the World, where 3 critically endangered languages were in the Philippines..One of these languages in the Southern Ayta (Sorsogon Ayta) language which has an estimated speaker of 150 people in the year 2000..The language was classified as Critically Endangered, meaning the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently and hardly pass the language to their children and grandchildren anymore..If the remaining 150 people do not pass their native language to the next generation of Sorsogon Ayta people, their indigenous language will be extinct within a period of 1 to 2 decades.
The Sorsogon Ayta people live only on the municipality of Prieto Diaz, Sorsogon..They are one of the original Negrito settlers in the entire Philippines..They belong to the Aeta people classification but have distinct language and belief systems unique to their own culture and heritage.

Sorsogon is predominantly a Catholic province..Spanish conquistadores gave Sorsogon its first encounter with Christianity..This was in the year 1569 when Fray Alonzo Jimenez, OSA, chaplain of the expedition under Luis Enriquez de Guzman celebrated the first Mass upon landing on the coast of sitio Gibal-ong (or Gibalon), barangay Siuton, in the town of Magallanes..Christianity, however, was formally established in Sorsogon with the planting of the Cross on the shores of Casiguran town in 1600 by the Franciscan Friars..This was a prelude to the erection of the first church building dedicated to the Holy Rosary, still revered at present as the Patroness of Casiguran..From there, the Franciscan missionaries devotedly spread the faith to the other towns in Bacon (1617), Bulusan (1630) and Donsol (1668)..The other twelve towns followed suit in the course of time..In the original geographic division, the province of Sorsogon formed part of Albay province..It seceded as a separate province on October 17, 1984..Catholicism is followed by 93% of the population of Sorsogon.
The Diocese of Sorsogon was originally part of the Archdiocese of Nueva Caceres..When it was made a separate diocese on June 29, 1951, it included the territory of Masbate..When the Diocese of Nueva Caceres was elevated into an archdiocese in the same year, Legazpi and Sorsogon were made suffragan dioceses of Nueva Caceres..On March 23, 1968, Masbate was made into a separate diocese..At present the Diocese of Sorsogon covers simply the civil province of Sorsogon and the City of Sorsogon with the Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral in Sorsogon City as its seat.
The Iglesia Ni Cristo (Church Of Christ) has the minority of this province each town has 2-3 locale chapels built, the whole province comprised 71 locale, and barangay chapels.
Superstitions and local legends and beliefs
Prior to colonization, the region had a complex religious system which involved various deities..These deities include: Gugurang, the supreme god who dwells inside of Mount Mayon where he guards and protects the sacred fire in which an Aswang (local version of witches and monsters) and, his brother was trying to steal..Whenever people disobey his orders, wishes and commit numerous sins, he would cause Mount Mayon to burst lava as a sign of warning for people to mend their crooked ways..Ancient Bikolanos had a rite performed for him called Atang..;

South Cotabato (Hiligaynon: Bagatnan Cotabato; Cebuano: Habagatang Cotabato; Maguindanaon: Salatan Kutawatu, Jawi: سلاتن كوتوات; Filipino: Timog Cotabato), officially the Province of South Cotabato, is a province in the Philippines located in the Soccsksargen region in Mindanao..Its capital is Koronadal, and it borders Sultan Kudarat to the north and west, Sarangani to the south and northeast, and Davao del Sur to the far northeast..To the southeast lies Sarangani Bay.
General Santos, located on the shores of Sarangani Bay, is the largest city in both the province and the region (by population), but is governed independently from the province..The province of Sarangani used to be part of South Cotabato until it was made an independent province in 1992.
History
Early history
Centuries ago, the area that would be the South Cotabato was sparsely inhabited by Maguindanaon pioneers and Lumads which are under Sultanate of Maguindanao's influence..The Spaniards launched expeditions to subdue the area throughout the colonial era but they never gained control of the region until the middle of the 19th century after the Spaniards established a military post at what is now Barangay Tamontaka, one of the earliest Christian settlements founded south of the Philippines, in present-day Cotabato City..Spaniards already took with them Chavacano-speaking Christians and Muslims from Zamboanga and Basilan, as well as the Visayans, especially the Hiligaynons and Cebuanos.
American invasion era
The area of what is now South Cotabato and Sarangani provinces used to be part of Davao province until 1914, when the reorganization of the districts in Mindanao took place, thus it became part of the then-undivided Cotabato province..Settlers, who would lay the foundation of what would become a progressive province, started trooping down 1914.
The significant thrust occurred during the term of President Quezon in late 1930s..General Paulino Santos led the first of wave of settlers that time.
Philippine independence
After World War II, the final exodus of settlers from Luzon and Visayas poured into the area's virgin land..In the early 1960s as population, trade and industries grew in southern part of Cotabato, a clamor of local self-governance arose..Thus, on July 18, 1966, South Cotabato was separated from Cotabato as an independent province..At that time, the province consisted of 11 municipalities, namely: Banga, South Cotabato, General Santos (now a city), Glan, Kiamba, Koronadal, Maitum, Norala, Polomolok, Surallah, Tantangan, and Tupi..These municipalities were established long before the creation of the province..Other component municipalities were formed after it fully functioned as a province.
With the creation of regions under Pres..Ferdinand Marcos, South Cotabato was grouped with Region XI, also known as Southern Mindanao, in 1975.
In 1992, the province of Sarangani was formed out of South Cotabato..Seven towns in southern and coastal section of the province (Malungon, Alabel, Malapatan, Glan, Maasim, Kiamba and Maitum) became part of the new province, leaving South Cotabato with 11 remaining municipalities.
Regional offices were relocated to South Cotabato in accordance with EO 429 dated October 12, 1990, issued by President Corazon C. Aquino during the expansion of the newly created Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao,
Contemporary
On August 16, 2000, Republic Act No..8803 was approved, that converted the municipality of Koronadal into a component city of South Cotabato.
In 2015, the National Competitiveness Council declared the province as the 4th most competitive province in the country.

When General Santos is included for geographical purposes, the province's population is 1,509,735 people, with a density of 341 inhabitants per square kilometre (880/sq mi).
Inhabitants
The people of South Cotabato have diverse heritages..The province's indigenous people are Blaan, Tboli and Maguindanaon..Ethnic Hiligaynons, descendants of migrants from Panay and Negros in the Visayas who settled in the municipalities/towns of Norala, Banga, Surallah, Santo Niño and the province's capital city, Koronadal, are the majority in the province..The province's major media of communication are Hiligaynon, Tagalog, and English..On the other hand, Ilocano-speaking peoples of Luzon settled in Tampakan, Tantangan and Tupi, and the Ilocano language may still be heard in these towns..The Cebuanos are the main ethnic group of the municipality of Polomolok, and are one of the main ethnic groups of Tupi (along with the Hiligaynons and Kapampangans)..Both towns are near to General Santos, which speaks both Hiligaynon and Cebuano..Chavacano speakers are even found scattered in some areas of the province, as well as Maguindanaons because of the province's history of being part of Sultanate of Maguindanao..Tbolis mainly reside around the Lake Sebu area, while Blaans reside within General Santos and its outskirts.

Roman Catholics predominate the province with 65% adherence, The remainder are divided among Buddhist and animism.
The Maguindanaon make up the majority of the Muslim population in the province..Other indigenous Filipino tribes are the T'boli and B'laan tribes in Lake Sebu and T'boli municipalities, famous for their brassworks, beadwork and t'nalak weave..The people of these tribes wear colorful embroidered native costumes and beadwork accessories..The women of these tribes, particularly, wear heavy brass belts with brass 'tassels' ending in tiny brass bells that herald their approach even when they are a long way off.
The people of South Cotabato retain many of the practices and traditions of their particular tribal heritages, although infused with a flavor that is distinctly Mindanaoan and the product of cultural interaction between the immigrants and the indigenous peoples of the area..One vivid example of this is the predominant use of the native malong, the colorful, tubelike garment used as a skirt by the indigenous tribes, in place of a blanket or sleeping bag.
Language
Hiligaynon is the most widely spoken language in the province..It is the main language in the capital city of Koronadal—earning its nickname ""the Ilonggo Capital of Mindanao""—and the municipalities of the Upper Valley region, namely, Surallah, Banga, Norala, Sto..Niño and Tantangan, followed by Cebuano, which is the majority language of General Santos and the main language in the Municipalities of Polomolok, Tampakan and Tupi..Tagalog and English are widely understood and often used for administrative functions by the local government and in education, with the former serving as dominant language in local media and of everyday communication of speakers of different languages, making it a secondary lingua franca in the province..Other languages spoken in the province are Maguindanaon, Tboli, Blaan, Kapampangan and Ilocano.

Southern Leyte (Cebuano: Habagatang Leyte; Kabalian: Habagatan nga Leyte; Waray: Salatan nga Leyte; Tagalog: Timog Leyte
The province ranks as the second least populated in the region, after the province of Biliran..According to the 2020 census, the province has a population of 429,573.
Southern Leyte's geological features created several issues in the province after the flooding of the Subangdaku River and the 2006 mudslide in Guinsaugon..Organizations warned the province it was susceptible to natural occurrences like landslides and floods.
Southern Leyte forms an important part of the inter-island transportation system of the country, with ferries transporting people and goods between Liloan and Surigao del Norte in Mindanao..The province is well known for its quality abaca products and is the country's major producer of abaca fiber.
In September 2017, Representative Roger Mercado authored House Bill 6408, proposing to change the name of the province to Leyte del Sur.
History
Early history
This section does not cite any sources..Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources..Unsourced material may be challenged and removed..(December 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this message)
The province, being part of Leyte island, is believed to be influenced by Datu Ete, ruler of the historic community of Mairete, meaning Land of Ete, which was centered in Tacloban..The area which is to be Southern Leyte is believed to have been occupied by animist Visayan ethnic groups from Bohol..There is no proof that the indigenous animist Warays of Samar, who at the time occupied northeast Leyte, ever occupied Southern Leyte.
Spanish colonial era
As early as 1898 during the Spanish and American periods, there existed a ""sub-province"" consisting of the municipalities from Palompon to Hinunangan, with Maasin as the center..Some government offices had already been established in Maasin on the southwestern part of Leyte to govern the area.
Historically, the governing city was the depository of cedula tax collections from Palompon to Hinunangan..This was administered by the office of the Administrado de Hacienda, equivalent to the Provincial Treasurer, a position under the Secretario de Hacienda.
There was also established in Maasin a Court of First Instance, then known as the Promoter Fiscal, where all minor administrative and other cases from Palompon to Hinunangan were heard.
During the Spanish colonization, the province was sparsely populated..The continued raiding of Moro slaves discouraged the province from growing and developing..However, in the 19th century immigrants from adjacent provinces like Bohol and Cebu populated the area.
Japanese occupation era
In 1942, Ruperto Kangleon held a conference in the town of Sogod, when the first meeting attempt in Malitbog, a town to the east, failed due to many leaders staying away..He was trying to unify all guerrillas helping the Philippine Commonwealth troops during World War II.
From 1944 to 1945, the Allied Philippine Commonwealth Army soldiers and Filipino guerrillas attacked the Japanese Imperial forces in an effort to liberate Southern Leyte, and American troops landed on Leyte on October 20, 1944.
Philippine independence
Independent province
Due to a change of sovereign powers, all the offices in Maasin except the Fiscal's Office were abolished and reverted to Tacloban, the capital of Leyte..This created a major problem because of the dearth of transportation, the difficulty in managing the affairs of government in Tacloban and the language barrier between the Cebuano-speaking South-westerners and the Waray-speaking North-easterners..The difficulty of managing the entire island from the main city suggested a need to separate the island into two provinces.
At first there was a general movement for a Western Leyte and soon after, many prominent men and leaders rallied behind the movement..Six attempts to pass a law for the division of Leyte were made..On the sixth attempt, then Congressman Nicanor Yñiguez introduced into the House a division law similar in substance to that of the Kangleon Bill, but recognizing the impossibility of creating an East-West Division, he instead opted to make his own district a province.
Abandoning the first bill, Congressman Nicanor Yñiguez presented House Bill No..1318 proposing a new province of Southern Leyte comprising Third Congressional District of Leyte to include sixteen municipalities, from Maasin to Silago in the mainland, and in the Panaon Island.
The bill became Republic Act 2227 otherwise known as an ""Act Creating the Province of Southern Leyte"" and was signed into Law by President Carlos P. Garcia on May 22, 1959.
Contemporary
Mudslides
In December 2003, a landslide in San Francisco, Southern Leyte destroyed most of the town, killing 200 people.
2006 Southern Leyte mudslide
Main article: 2006 Southern Leyte mudslide
On February 17, 2006, several mudslides caused by heavy rains, amounting over 200 cm (79 in), and a minor earthquake destroyed at least one town and many commercial and residential infrastructures, leaving hundreds dead..The municipality of Saint Bernard was one of the worst hit areas with 23 confirmed deaths, up to 200 estimated deaths and another 1,500 missing..Barangay Guinsaugon, a mountain village on the said municipality with 2,500 people, was almost completely destroyed, killing 1,800 of its 1,857 residents..Many rescuers from national and international responded to the incident..However, rescue efforts were greatly hampered by poor road conditions and lack of heavy equipment..Survivors also reported lack of coordination of rescue efforts..The few handful of Guinsaugon citizens which escaped the mudslide were put up in emergency shelters without adequate nutrition and care despite the National Government collecting millions of dollars worth of donations.
Geography
Southern Leyte occupies the southern quarter of the island of Leyte..It is bounded by the province of Leyte to the north, by Surigao Strait to the east, Bohol Sea to the south, and Canigao Channel, across from Bohol, to the west..Its total land area is 1,798.61 square kilometres (694.45 sq mi)..The central portion of the province is dominated by the Sogod Bay, a long bay that cuts deep into the island.
Topography
A view of Sogod Bay and the town of Sogod
Southern Leyte is characterized by relatively flat lands along the coastal areas where population centers lie, but rugged mountains towards the interior.
The province has inland water features..Based on national data, the province has altogether 93 rivers, including 18 major ones, namely the Amparo River in Macrohon, the Canturing River in Maasin, the Das-ay and Pondol Rivers in Hinunangan, the Divisoria River in Bontoc, the Hitungao and Lawigan Rivers in Saint Bernard, the Maag River in Silago, and the Subangdaku River in Sogod which is the biggest of all..The province has an inland lake called Lake Danao located in the mountains of San Juan and Anahawan, towns in the eastern region.
Green grass covering mountains in Maasin
Subangdaku, the province's largest river, created an issue over the area..It can be considered a braided river composed of several channels from near areas that divide and reunite forming an alluvial fan with a very wide floodplain..As such, the river usually became hazardous during typhoons after heavy rains.
Along with other mountain forms in the province, Mount Nacolod in Hinunangan town has the highest peak with an elevation of 948 metres (3,110 ft) above sea level..Young volcanic rocks are discovered in the terrain areas, which cover the top of the southern mountain ranges of Mount Cabalian in the Pacific Area and Mount Nelangcapan in Panaon Area.
The province lies within the Philippine Fault System..The major fault lines traverse the municipalities of Sogod, Libagon, Saint Bernard and San Juan to Panaon Island..Based on Mines and Geosciences Bureau Region 8 data, these areas had experienced strong earthquakes in 1907 and 1948 with a magnitude of 6.9 and on July 5, 1984, with a 6.4 scale.
The province has numerous types of soil..Soil types within the Maasin Clay, Guimbalaon Clay, Himay-angan Clay, Bolinao Clay, Quingua Clay and Malitbog Clay series serve as raw materials for ceramics and pottery made by local residents.
Climate
Southern Leyte has two types of climate according to the Coronas Classification..These are Type II and Type IV.
Type II is characterized by the absence of dry season with a very pronounced maximum rain period occurring from November to January..This type prevails in the eastern half of the province that includes the municipality of Sogod, Libagon, Liloan, San Francisco, Pintuyan, San Ricardo, Saint Bernard, San Juan, Anahawan, Hinundayan, Hinunangan and Silago..On the other hand, Type IV has a rainfall that is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year..This type prevails in the western part of the province that includes the City of Maasin and the municipalities of Macrohon, Padre Burgos, Limasawa, Malitbog, Tomas Oppus, Bontoc and little part of Sogod.
In 2004, the province recorded a maximum temperature of 30.95 °C (87.71 °F) and a minimum temperature of 24.09 °C (75.36 °F)..In addition, mean minimum temperature was 25.24 °C (77.43 °F)..The province has 163 rainy days per year and total rainfall of 1,729.20 millimetres (68.079 in).
Vegetation and biodiversity

Inhabitants of the province plant rice, white corn, bananas, root crops, sugar cane, coconut and abacá.
A three-year project was established in Sogod Bay conducted by the Southern Leyte Coral Reef Conservation Project (SLCRCP) to surveyed coral reefs in the area..The undertaking was to provide local residents educational opportunities to have knowledge on protecting the province's biodiversity as well as to have a long-term sustainability.
Administrative divisions
Southern Leyte is subdivided into 18 municipalities and 1 city, all encompassed by a double legislative districts and further subdivided into 500 barangays.
The province originally comprised 16 municipalities and 349 barangays, with four islands: Panaon Island, Limasawa Island, San Pedro Island and San Pablo Island..After the inauguration of the province, three more municipalities were subsequently created: San Ricardo from Pintuyan, Tomas Oppus from Malitbog and Limasawa from Padre Burgos.
In 2000, Maasin was converted into a city as capital of Southern Leyte..The remaining component municipality classes ranges from 2nd to 5th level in the province..From 2nd class belongs Sogod municipality which is the center of trade, commerce and industry among municipalities within the Sogod Bay..Hinunangan, which holds the distinction as the ""Rice Granary of the Province"" for its vast plain land that is entirely planted with rice, Liloan, Malitbog, Saint Bernard, and Macrohon, are in the 4th level..The remaining municipalities—Anahawan, Hinundayan, Libagon, Padre Burgos, Pintuyan, San Francisco, San Juan (formerly Cabalian), San Ricardo, Silago, Tomas Oppus and Limasawa, a component island to the south—are under 5th level.

Religion
Our Lady of Assumption Cathedral in Maasin
Limasawa, an island municipality to the south, is believed to be the site of the first Christian mass in Philippine soil and the birthplace of Christianity in the Philippines, when Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese navigator and explorer landed on March 28, 1521..The first Holy Sacrifice of the Mass was held on March 31, 1521, led by Friar Pedro de Valderrama, the chaplain of Ferdinand Magellan during the expedition..The mass marked the start of Christian propagation.
Culture
Beliefs
Although most people are Christians, a very few who live in remote villages of the province hold on to pre-Hispanic influences and make offerings and sacrifices before planting their crops..Farmers ritually sacrifice chickens and pigs to ensure that the spirits or elementals which they believe to be the cause of good harvest will grant them one.
Religious events
Fiesta, a Spanish term meaning ""festivity"", is celebrated in the province with prayer, food, drinking, dance and music..Every barangay of every town in the province has its own celebration date..For instance, Hinunangan celebrates a town fiesta on the June 29 with the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Fluvial boat parade the day before.
The province also holds its own festivals..""Sinulog sa malitbog"" is an annual religious street pageant in Malitbog to pay homage to the Holy Child Jesus (Santo Niño), the town's patron saint..Similarly, the historic and religious coming of the Spaniards is commemorated every March 31 in Limasawa with a cultural presentation and anniversary program dubbed ""Sinugdan"", meaning ""beginning."".Other festivals held in the province to highlight events are the Pagkamugna Festival and Pabulhon Festival in Maasin, Karomata Festival in Beunavista, Pintuyan, Tangka-tangka Festival in Tangkaan, Padre Burgos and Manha‑on Festival in Macrohon.

Farming
Coconut
Most of the people in Southern Leyte go into coconut planting, a widely distributed industry, especially in mountainous and even plain regions..The GIZ of the German Development Cooperation has embarked on a value chain study on one of the most important products in Region 8 – the coconut, particularly in Leyte and Southern Leyte.
In the year 2004, a beetle pest threatened the Philippine coconut industry including Visayas..Brontispa longissima causes great damage to seedlings and mature coconut trees and ornamental palms, killing the young spears and eventually the entire trees.
Abaca
People in Southern Leyte also go into abaca planting..The province is one of the major producer of abaca fiber in the country along with Catanduanes, Leyte, Davao Oriental, Northern Samar, Sorsogon, Sulu, Davao del Sur, and Surigao del Sur..The fibers from Leyte and the province are recognized as having the best quality.
In 2003, Abaca bunchy top virus threatened the abaca industry in the province..Almost all of the abaca-producing municipalities in the area namely Maasin, Padre Burgos, Malitbog, Tomas Oppus, Bontoc, Sogod, St. Bernard, San Juan, Hinunangan and Silago were greatly affected by the deadly virus except from the municipalities at Panaon Island..Eighty percent of the province's abaca, particularly in Sogod town, was greatly affected while Maasin was estimated to suffer about 30 percent in damages.
Tourism
Some 200,000 tourists visit Southern Leyte each year.
Domestic tourism is mostly those wishing to enjoy the sandy beaches, hotels and resorts along the coastline..Significant numbers also visit for religious festivals such as Sinulog and Limasawa
Most international travelers visit Southern Leyte for reef diving and snorkeling, from just outside Maasin City, all the way around Sogod Bay via Padre Burgos..There are also an increasing number of non-divers who come to see the whale sharks between October and April.
In recent years in the Philippines.

Abaca fiber helps livelihood in the province..Women in the selected areas go into abaca-based handicrafts, which is widely known in the area as tagak or spooled abaca fiber..Natives usually called it as tinagak or continuous spooled abaca fiber..The half-finished product is then made into sinamay or hand woven clothe out of tinagak ready to be made into other sinamay‑based products..Products are being exported by Leyte to Japan..Because of a wide distribution of an industry called tagak, provincial sectors taught farmers on how to cultivate a suitable variety locally called laylay.
In Bontoc, a project was successfully established with a mudcrab hatchery with eleven hatchery tanks at the RKKMAFTI Compound..Initially, 25 spawners are being worked-on by the project.
Aside from abaca-based products, ceramics and handicraft items made from coconut and bamboo are also the province's industry..Among the province's economic activities are fishing, livestock and poultry raising.
Generally, rice is the staple food of the province, and corn is also used..Mountain‑living folks, however, prefer root crops, which are abundant..Native delicacies of the province include tres marias, bocarillo, 'salvaro, bibingka, and starhoy..They also have their own kinilaw.
Infrastructure
Communication
Postal communication is the main mode of communication in the province..There are five telephone exchange companies operating in the province and two radio stations..These two radio stations (Radio Natin and DYSL) are located in Sogod.
Transportation
The road network of Southern Leyte consists of major arterial highways that link the province to Leyte, passing through two major outlets..On the western part is the Maasin-Mahaplag-Baybay and the central part by the Mahaplag‑Sogod road via the Maharlika Highway..On the eastern part of the province, the opening of the new Abuyog‑Silago Roads provides fast and convenient travel to the eastern towns of Southern Leyte..Maharlika road contributes to the development of the province.
There are six designated bus terminals in Southern Leyte: Maasin, Liloan, Sogod, San Juan, Hinunangan and Silago..However, these terminals are open spaces used by buses as parking areas and are therefore not equipped with buildings and other facilities.
Southern Leyte has a total of 11 seaports, two of which are declared as national ports, the Maasin and Liloan ports, and the 10 are municipal ports..Of these 10 ports, five are operational: Maasin, Liloan, Saint Bernard, San Juan and Sogod..By sea, travel to Cebu from Maasin port takes an average of six hours and a maximum of two hours..A ferryboat from Liloan to Surigao takes three hours.
The province has only one existing airport, Panan-awan Airport located in Maasin..At present,

Sultan Kudarat, officially the Province of Sultan Kudarat (Hiligaynon: Kapuoran sang Sultan Kudarat; Maguindanaon: Dairat nu Sultan Kudarat, Jawi: دايرت نو سولتان كودرت; Cebuano: Lalawigan sa Sultan Kudarat; Ilocano: Probinsia ti Sultan Kudarat; Filipino: Lalawigan ng Sultan Kudarat), is a province in the Philippines located in the Soccsksargen region in Mindanao..Its capital is Isulan and the commercial center is Tacurong.
On February 23, 1995, Sultan Kudarat transferred from the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (now Bangsamoro Autonomous Region) to Soccsksargen.
Etymology
The name Sultan Kudarat given to the province was derived from the Maguindanaon Muslim ruler, Sultan Muhammad Dipatuan Kudarat who began to assert his leadership in the year 1619 and reigned in the Sultanate of Maguindanao from 1625 to 1671..Through his leadership, Spanish forces were successfully repelled from encroaching the Cotabato region of south-central Mindanao.
History
Further information: Maguindanao Sultanate
Sultan Kudarat was once part of the Sultanate of Maguindanao..It became one of the strongholds of the Maguindanao society as some royal families established their own Sultanate in the region.
Sultan Kudarat was part of the former province of Cotabato, until its creation as an independent province (along with Maguindanao and North Cotabato) on November 22, 1973, through Presidential Decree No..341.
Further information: Cotabato Province (1914-1973)
Palimbang Massacre
Main article: Palimbang massacre
One notable event that took place in Sultan Kudarat was the Palimbang Massacre (also called the  Malisbong Masjid Massacre), which saw the mass murder of Moro residents of Barrio Malisbong in Palimbang by units of the Philippine Military on September 24, 1974,
Sultan Kudarat (Tacurong) Bird Festival
Tacurong will hold the 8th ""Sultan Kudarat Bird Festival"" at the 2.5-hectare Baras Bird Sanctuary, the largest nesting site of 20,000 bird species, especially egrets and herons, on May 10-11, 2024.
Geography
Sultan Kudarat is situated in the southwestern section of central Mindanao..It is bounded on the north by the provinces of Maguindanao del Norte, Maguindanao del Sur and Cotabato; on the south by South Cotabato and Sarangani; on the east by Davao del Sur; and on the west by the Moro Gulf and the Celebes Sea..The province's total land area is 5,298.34 square kilometres (2,045.70 sq mi).
The Moro Gulf seen from Lebak
Two major mountain ranges encompass the province; the Alip Mountain Range in Columbio and the Daguma Mountain Range within the towns of Bagumbayan, Isulan, and Esperanza.
The province has an irregular coastline of 132 kilometres (82 mi) in its three coastal towns, which face the Celebes Sea.
Land use and soil types
Forestland constitutes the majority of the province's land use (50.32% ), followed by agricultural land (44.77%), fishing grounds (2.42%), non-agricultural land (1.16%), ""other bodies of water"" (1.02%), and fishponds (0.31%).

Climate
The climate of Sultan Kudarat falls under Type IV of Climate (characterized by rain showers or evenly distributed rainfall throughout the year)..Heavy rainfall occurs from April to November..Unlike most other provinces in the country, Sultan Kudarat is generally free from typhoons as it is situated outside the ""typhoon belt"".
The average temperature is 35 °C (95 °F), with 38 °C (100 °F) as the average maximum normally occurring in March..The lowest recorded was 18 °C (64 °F) in the Kulaman area from December to early January.
Administrative divisions
Sultan Kudarat comprises 11 municipalities and 1 city..Three of the municipalities (Kalamansig, Lebak, and Palimbang) are coastal towns, while the rest of the province is located inland..The 11 municipalities and Tacurong City are further subdivided into 249 barangays.
Tacurong City is the smallest unit in the province by land area, but is the most urbanized and is considered the province's commercial center..Other growth centers are Lebak and Isulan, the latter being the provincial capital.

Sulu (), officially the Province of Sulu (Tausūg: Wilāya sin Lupa' Sūg; Tagalog: Lalawigan ng Sulu), is a province of the Philippines in the Sulu Archipelago and part of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).
Its capital is Jolo on the island of the same name..Maimbung, the royal capital of the Sultanate of Sulu, is also located in the province..Sulu is along the southern border of the Sulu Sea and the northern boundary of the Celebes Sea.
Out of all 82 provinces in the Philippines, it is the poorest, as evidenced by it having the highest poverty rate.
History
Early history
Further information: Sultanate of Sulu and Spanish–Moro conflict
Prior to the arrival of Islam in Sulu, the province used to adhere to local animist religions; this later changed to Hindu and Buddhist belief systems..Throughout this time, the Kingdom of Lupah Sug had been established centuries before Islam arrived.
The advent of Islam around 1138 through merchants and traders had a distinct influence on Southeast Asia..The coming of Arabs, Persians and other Muslims paved the way for the arrival of religious missionaries, traders, scholars and travelers to Sulu and Mindanao in the 12th century.

A landmark born of the social process was the founding of the Sultanate of Sulu..Year 1380 CE, The Sunni Sufi Scholar Karim-ul Makhdum came to Sulu and introduced Islam to the Philippines..In 1450 CE, Johore-born Arab adventurer Sayyid Abubakar Abirin came to Sulu and lived with Rajah Baguinda Ali..The Sunni Sufi Teacher and Sayyid Abubakar eventually married Ali's daughter, Dayang-dayang Paramisuli, and inherited Rajah Baguinda's polity (which was a principality before), which he turned into the Sultanate of Sulu and become its first Sultan..To consolidate his rule, Sayyid Abubakar united the local political units under the umbrella of the Sultanate..A Sultanate that followed the Ash'ari Aqeeda, Shafi'i Madh'hab and Sufism..He brought Sulu, Zamboanga Peninsula, Palawan, and Basilan under its aegis.
Spanish colonial era
The navigational error that landed Ferdinand Magellan in Limasawa brought awareness of Europe to the Philippines and opened the door to Spanish colonial incursion..The Spaniards introduced Christianity and a political system of church-state dichotomy, which encountered fierce resistance in the devastating Moro wars from 1578 to 1899..The Sultanate of Sulu formally recognised Spanish sovereignty in Tawi-Tawi and Sulu in middle of 19th century, but these areas remained partially ruled by the Spanish as their sovereignty was limited to military stations, garrisons, and pockets of civilian settlements, until they had to abandon the region as a consequence of their defeat in the Spanish–American War.
American era
Further information: Moro Province and Department of Mindanao and Sulu
After Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States, American forces came to Jolo and ended the 23 years of Spanish military occupation (1876 to 1899)..On August 20, Sultan Jamalul Kiram II and Brig..Gen. John C. Bates signed the Bates Agreement that continued the gradual emasculation of the Sultanate started by Spain (Treaty of 1878) until March 1915 when the Sultan abdicated his temporal powers in the Carpenter Agreement..The Agreement eliminated opposition to the civilian government of Gov..Clinton Solidum.
Sulu in 1918, which covered the current province of Tawi-Tawi
The Department of Mindanao and Sulu under Gov..Carpenter was created by Philippine Commission Act 2309 (1914) and ended on February 5, 1920, by Act of Philippine Legislature No..2878..The Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes was organized and briefly headed by Teofisto Guingona Sr. With the enactment by the US Congress of the Jones Law (Philippine Autonomy Law) in 1916, ultimate Philippine independence was guaranteed and the Filipinization of public administration began..Sulu, however, had an appointed American governor until 1935, and the Governor General in Manila had a say in Sulu affairs.
At any rate, the essence of local governance forged by Rajah Baguinda continued to permeate the ethos of Sulu politics despite centuries of colonial presence..History points to a local government in Sulu that antedates other similar systems in the country.
The province hosted the Daru Jambangan (Palace of Flowers) which was the royal palace of the Sultan of Sulu since historical times..The palace, located in Maimbung was made of wood, and was destroyed in 1932 by a huge storm.
Japanese occupation
During the brief Japanese occupation years, Sulu was bombed by the Japanese and was conquered afterwards..The Japanese were eventually expelled by the Americans and the natives of Sulu, and the Americans started to push for the independence of the Philippines as 'one country'..This prompted various leaders from Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago to campaign against being lumped with the Catholic natives of Luzon and the Visayas..Despite the campaign against the 'one Philippines model', the United States granted independence to the Philippines, effectively giving control of Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago to the Filipino government in Manila.
Daru Jambangan (Palace of Flowers) in Maimbung before it was destroyed by a typhoon..The palace was the seat of the Sultanate of Sulu's reigning monarch for generations.
Philippine independence
At the beginning of Philippine independence era, the reconstruction of the Daru Jambangan continued to be of huge importance to the people of Sulu as only a few arches and posts remain from the once grand palace complex..Many members of the royal family advocated for the reconstruction of the palace, however, the government of the Philippines made no official position or fund for the matter..During that time, the Mindanao sentiment to become a free country on its own was also felt in Sulu.
In 1948, Hadji Kamlon, a World War II veteran, started an uprising on Luuk, Sulu..He surrendered in 1949 but started another uprising in 1952..He then surrendered on July 31, 1952, to Secretary of Defense Ramon Magsaysay..However, he started a third uprising a week later..He surrendered again on November 9, 1952, but would start another uprising in early 1953..He would then surrender on August 11, 1953, after an encounter with Philippines Government troops..He violated the terms of his surrender a week later..Two years later, on September 24, 1955, he would then surrender after an encounter with government troops in Tandu Panuan, Luuk.
In 1973, the municipalities of South Ubian, Tandubas, Simunul, Sitangkai, Balimbing (Panglima Sugala), Bungao, Cagayan de Sulu (Mapun), and Turtle Island were transferred from the jurisdiction of Sulu to the newly formed province of Tawi-Tawi pursuant to Presidential Decree No..302 of September 11, 1973.
The Marcos Administration
During Marcos era, Sulu was one of the provinces that fought back against Ferdinand Marcos as his regime tortured, killed, and exterminated hundreds of Moros..When news broke out regarding the planned invasion of eastern Sabah, Marcos ordered the military to massacre Tausug warriors, which led to the brutal 1968 Jabidah massacre, the worst human rights violation against the natives of Sulu.
News about the Jabidah Massacre led to the rise of numerous separatist movements in Mindanao, including Sulu, eventually leading to groups engaging in armed conflict with the Philippine government.
The Sultan of Sulu, members of the royal family, and the leaders of Sulu were in favor of the People Power Revolution in Manila that successfully toppled the dictatorship and restored democracy in the country.
Contemporary
In 1989, the province of Sulu became part of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao or ARMM..A peace pact between the Moro National Liberation Front or MNLF and the Philippine government was also made..The founder and leader of the MNLF, Nur Misuari, who was a native of Sulu and adhered to the Sultanate of Sulu, became the governor of the entire ARMM from 1996 to 2001.
In 2016, a small replica of Daru Jambangan was built in the neighboring town of Talipao and became a centerpiece for a 'vacation park'..The replica was about 25% of the actual size of the real Daru Jambangan during its heyday..A campaign to restore the Daru Jambangan in its original location in Maimbung is still ongoing..The National Commission for Culture and the Arts and the National Museum of the Philippines were tasked to faithfully restore or reconstruct the Daru Jambangan in Maimbung.
In 2019, the Bangsamoro autonomy plebiscite led to the ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) creating the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) to replace the ARMM..The initiative lost by a 54.3% margin in Sulu, but was carried nonetheless because the votes of the entire ARMM were counted as one..(Several other localities in Mindanao which had not originally been part of the ARMM also ratified the BOL and were thus added to the BARMM.)

The population of Sulu in the 2020 census was 1,000,108 people, with a density of 620 inhabitants per square kilometre or 1,600 inhabitants per square mile.
Although consisting of a mixed community of Muslims, the Tausugs dominate the Sulu Archipelago..The Tausug were among the first inhabitants of the Philippines to embrace Islam as a religion and a way of life..They are referred to as 'people of the current', reflective of their close ties to the sea.
Religion
Tulay Mosque in Jolo
Sulu inhabitants are predominantly Muslim, constituting about 99% of the provincial population in 2015.
A majority of Sulu's Muslim population practice Sunni Islam of the Shafi'i tradition, as taught by Arab, Persian, Indian Muslim, Chinese Muslim and Malaccan missionaries from the 14th Century onwards.
Relatively newer Islamic sects, mostly brought by returning veterans of the Afghan wars and missionaries from Pakistan's stricter Sufi traditions, referred to as the Tableegh, have been active in propagating what they believe to be a ""purer"" Islamic way of life and worship..A very small number who have since married into Iranian or Iraqi families have converted to Shiite Islam.
The majority of Sulu Christians are Catholics..They are under the jurisdiction of Archdiocese of Zamboanga through its suffragan Apostolic Vicariate of Jolo..Non-Catholic Christians include Evangelicals, Jesus Miracle Crusade, Episcopalian, Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), Mormons, Seventh-day Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and a number of other Protestant denominations..Only the most recent Chinese immigrants adhere to Buddhism or Taoism, while most of the older Chinese families have acculturated and have either converted to Christianity or Islam while retaining many of their Chinese beliefs.
Languages
The Tausug language is the lingua franca of Sulu..The other local language is the indigenous Sama, which is widely used in varied tones and accents..This variety led to the development of Sinama dialects..The major ones are Sinama Sibutu (spoken mainly in the Sibutu-Sitangkai Region), Sinama Simunul (concentrated in Simunul-Manuk-Mangkaw Islands), Sinama Kapoan (spoken in the South Ubian-Tandubas and Sapa-Sapa Regions) and Sinama Banguingui (concentrated in Buan Island and spoken by Banguingui people).
The Bajau-Sama language is also spoken, as are the official languages of Filipino and English..Many locals and barter traders can speak Sabah Malay, while Chavacano is also spoken by Christian and Muslim locals who maintain contacts and trade with the mainland Zamboanga Peninsula and Basilan.

Sulu is predominantly agricultural with farming and fishing as its main livelihood activities..Its fertile soil and ideal climate can grow a variety of crops such as abaca, coconuts, Sulu coffee, oranges, and lanzones as well as exotic fruits seldom found elsewhere in the country such as durian and mangosteen.
Fishing is the most important industry since the Sulu Sea is one of the richest fishing grounds in the country..The province also has an extensive pearl industry, with a pearl farm on Marungas Island..The backs of sea turtles are made into beautiful trays and combs..During breaks from fishing, the people build boats and weave mats..Other industries include coffee processing and fruit preservation.
The handicrafts of Sulu have both Islamic and Malay influences..Skilled artisans make boats, bladed weapons, bronze and brassware, pis cloth, embroidered textiles, shellcraft, traditional house carvings, and carved wooden grave markers.
The province used to be one of the most prosperous in the southern Philippines..However, due to conflicts, terrorism, and the establishment of jihadists groups following Wahhabism such as the Abu Sayyaf, the province's economy has suffered badly and has been reduced to its current state.
Transportation
After the success of new flight of Philippine Airlines inside Bangsamoro region, the government is already looking forward to open the route to Cotabato City..As of to date Gove

Surigao del Norte (Surigaonon: Probinsya nan Surigao del Norte; Cebuano: Amihanang Surigao; Tagalog: Hilagang Surigao), officially the Province of Surigao del Norte, is a province in the Philippines located in the Caraga region of Mindanao..The province was formerly under the jurisdiction of Region 10 (Northern Mindanao) until 1995..Its capital is Surigao City..The province comprises two major islands—Siargao and Bucas Grande—in the Philippine Sea, plus a small area at the northeastern tip of mainland Mindanao and other surrounding minor islands and islets..This mainland portion borders Agusan del Norte – between the Municipality of Alegria in Surigao del Norte and the Municipality of Kitcharao in Agusan del Norte; and the province of Surigao del Sur, to the south.
Surigao del Norte is the second northernmost of the Mindanao provinces and is an important commerce and transportation hub between Visayas and Mindanao..Numerous ferries cross the Surigao Strait between Surigao and the island of Leyte transporting vehicles, cargoes, and passengers between Liloan in Southern Leyte and Surigao City.
Etymology
See also: List of Philippine provincial name etymologies
There are two presumptions on the original meaning of ""Surigao"" among linguists, depending on the original root word..If the root word was taken to be sulig (""sprout"" or ""spring up""), then Surigao may have derived from suligao (""spring water""), likely referring to the Surigao River (known as ""Suligaw"" in Mandaya) that empties at the northern tip of the island of Mindanao.
Another possibility is that it is derived from Visayan ""surogao"" or ""suyogao,"" meaning ""water current""..From suyog (also sulog or surog), ""current""..Other Visayan words derived from the same root include Sinulog, Sulu, and Tausug (Suluk).
History
Further information: Surigao (province)
Map of the historical province of Surigao in 1918
Spanish colonial era
Rajah Siawi and Rajah Kulambo, members of the nobility of the Surigaonon and Butuanon people, respectively, were encountered by the Magellan expedition in 1521 on the island of Limasawa (which was a hunting ground for the rulers)..Antonio Pigafetta describes them as being tattooed and covered in gold ornaments..Pigafetta also records the name of the Surigao region as ""Calagan""..: 141–142
The explorer Ruy López de Villalobos headed an expedition to Surigao in 1543, an attempt at subjugation which failed because of the resistance of the natives..At that time the island of Mindanao was given the name Caesarea Caroli, in honor of Carlos V of Spain..Jesuit missionaries visited Butuan in 1597 but did not make much progress in Christianizing the people..It was not until 1609, when a full-dress expedition was launched, that Spanish authority was imposed to Tandag..In 1622, the arrival of the Recollect missionaries in Tandag commenced the establishment of a permanent mission in Surigao.
The area of Surigao del Norte was once part of an ancient district referred to as ""Caraga"" during the Spanish colonial period named after its chief inhabitants, the Caraga tribe or Caragans who were largely concentrated in a settlement called Caraga..The ancient district of Caraga, which was established in 1609 comprised all of the present day provinces of Surigao del Norte, Dinagat Islands, Surigao del Sur, the northern part of Davao Oriental and eastern Misamis Oriental..The seat of government was at Tandag until it was transferred to the town of Surigao in 1848..Six Spanish military districts were established in Mindanao in 1860 and the areas of present-day Surigao del Norte, Surigao del Sur, Dinagat Islands, Agusan del Norte and Agusan del Sur (collectively called Agusan back then), including the territory lying between present day Butuan and Caraga bays, formed the third district called the ""East District"" which was changed in 1870 to ""Distrito de Surigao""..By the end of the Spanish rule in 1897, Agusan had been organized as a single politico-military comandancia named ""Butuan"", within the administrative jurisdiction of Distrito de Surigao.
Surigao during the Philippine Revolution
On December 23, 1898, the last Spanish Governor of Surigao turned his authority over to a provisional Filipino ""Junta Provincial"" Peacefully..The Spanish Government along with the Spanish community soon left Surigao by the next day on December 24 leaving behind Spanish missionaries..They were sent off with the sound of music and goodwill by the locals..The Junta Provincial elected Jantoy Gonzalez to serve as the Provisional head while waiting for the arrival of the new authority from Luzon that was sent by Aguinaldo.
First and Official Flag Raising in Mindanao..Father Alberto Masoliver, S.J., during his stint as the parish priest of Surigao in 1898, kept a compilation of his diaries, entitled Diario de la Casa de Surigao..His diaries are currently stored in the Jesuit archives at Centro Borja, Sant Cugat del Valles, Spain..He thus wrote on December 26, 1898, ""Before 10:00 AM, the tri-color was hoisted from Casa Real seat of provincial government) and the Tribunal … without any formalities … without anybody's attention being drawn…..these people have no idea of what it is all about, and if they have… how peaceful and without malice they are.""..Surigao then was the cabecera and the seat of government of the province of Caraga which had jurisdiction over Surigao, Butuan and Cagayan de Misamis (Cagayan de Oro)..Alejandro (Jantoy) Gonzalez was the president of the Junta Provincial of Surigao during the time of the first flag hoisting.
The New Authority under Aguinaldo's Supreme Revolutionary Government arrived in Surigao by January 12, 1899, they were the brothers Simon and Wenceslao Gonzales, children of Jantoy Gonzales.
Confiscation of Church Estate
Immediately after the arrival of the Gonzalez Brothers, they carried the orders of the Malolos Leadership which included the imprisonment of Spanish Missionaries, Confiscation of Church funds and other church properties.
American Occupation
Garcia Coup
by March 24, 1899, a new military and political figure appeared in Surigao..Don Prudencio Garcia staged a coup which resulted in the imprisonment of the Gonzalezes (Jantoy, Simon, and Wencaslao), and were killed shortly after in Cortez (now Surigao Del Sur).Finally, on April 2, 1899, at 12 midnight they were put in a boat, well handcuffed, and shipped out to the Pacific, and upon arriving at Cortes they shot them down..They had been guarded by soldiers and officials who were all personal enemies of the Gonzalezes..In Cortes they were put under the custody of a mestizo, Hilarion Marinez, whom the Gonzalezes had maltreated by words and deeds..He avenged himself by having them fusilated..That was the Tragic end of our enemies (""Apuntes..."" p. 116)The news of what led to the deaths of the Gonzalezes did not reach Aguinaldo as they were given false information to their deaths..Aguinaldo was given a message from an ""unknown correspondent"" which stated""General Simon Gonzales and his brother Wencaslao, the Governor of Surigao has been assassinated for collecting excessive contribution in money for the war, and their successors have also been assassinated by the Moros who form a greater part of the population and who have revolted against Filipino rule"" (Philippine Insurgent Record 1039.5 in Taylor)the letter stated that the Gonzales were assassinated, and that the Moros were blamed for the deaths of the predecessors despite having barely any Moros in Surigao by that time.
Narciso v. Garcia
After the execution of the Gonzalezes, Hermenegildo Narciso (A former ally of Garcia) grabbed the position of Governor..By around July 1899, around 400 men armed against Garcia took position outside the Provincial Capital (Surigao City) with 80 men in the trenches near the exit of the town..On July 8, 1899, Garcia returned to Surigao from Banganga with all the honors befitting as a General..Governor Narciso (who was still in Manila) was expected to return to Surigao to take full control of the Provincial Junta.
July 6, 1899, Soldiers (Garcia) began defending the Government house and Military Quarters in Provincial Capital, and at 6 o'clock Garcia's Soldiers and Narciso's soldiers had a shooting exchange..By 7 o'clock Garcia prepared to leave Surigao via sea..The soldiers of Narciso began their offensive when the boat started loading equipment..They took position behind the Acacia trees, and once they were discovered both sides exchanged fire..Garcia's soldiers retreated to the port and those who were not able to ride the boat with General Garcia were forced to hide and surrender..The area of the conflict is at the present day Surigao Luneta Park and alongside the street of Borromeo..The Province of Surigao would then be engulfed in Military rivalry between Governor Narciso and General Garcia, with Surigao and Butuan held by Narciso while Placer, Cantilan, and Tandag being held by Garcia..This Military Rivalry would be put to a close by the American Occupation of the Province.
Division of Surigao
Distrito de Surigao became a chartered province on May 15, 1901 (Philippine Commission Act 127)..The territorial expanse of the Surigao province was further reduced in 1907 when the politico-military commandancia of Butuan, then a sub-province of Surigao, was created into a separate province and officially named it Agusan with present-day Butuan as its capital.
Philippine independence
On September 18, 1960, through Republic Act 2786 dated June 19, 1960, the province of Surigao was divided into the present-day provinces of Surigao del Norte and Surigao del Sur..Agusan province was later dissolved and divided into the present-day provinces of Agusan del Norte (retains present day Butuan as capital) and Agusan del Sur in 1967 by Republic Act No..4979.
Contemporary
Dinagat Islands had been a part of the First District of Surigao del Norte until becoming a province on its own on December 2, 2006, with the approval of Republic Act No..9355, the Charter of the Province of Dinagat Islands, in a plebiscite..Between February 2010 and March 2011, the islands were part again of Surigao del Norte after declaring RA 9355 unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, then were reinstated as a separate province.

Surigao del Sur (Surigaonon: Probinsya nan Surigao del Sur; Cebuano: Habagatang Surigao; Tagalog: Timog Surigao), officially the Province of Surigao del Sur, is a province in the Philippines located in the Caraga region in Mindanao..Its capital is Tandag City..Surigao del Sur is situated at the eastern coast of Mindanao and faces the Philippine Sea to the east.
Etymology
See also: List of Philippine provincial name etymologies
There are two hypotheses on the original meaning of ""Surigao"" among linguists, depending on the original root word..If the root word was taken to be sulig (""sprout"" or ""spring up""), then Surigao may have derived from suligao (""spring water""), likely referring to the Surigao River (known as ""Suligaw"" in Mandaya) that empties at the northern tip of the island of Mindanao.
Another possibility is that it is derived from Visayan surogao or suyogao, meaning ""water current""..From suyog (also sulog or surog), ""current""; cf..Sinulog, Sulu, and Tausug (Suluk).
History

Early history
In precolonial times, the region of Surigao was inhabited by the Visayan Surigaonon people in the coastal areas, as well as Lumad groups in the interiors like the Mandaya, Mansaka, Mamanwa and Manobo.
Spanish colonial era
During the Spanish Occupation in 1860, six military districts were created in Mindanao, with Surigao and Agusan forming the ""East District""..In 1870, the district was renamed to ""Distrito de Surigao"".
American invasion era
In 1901, Distrito de Surigao became chartered province..Agusan became an independent province in 1907 during the American era, when it was separated from Surigao.
Philippine independence
Foundation
Surigao del Sur was created as the 56th Philippine province on June 19, 1960, through Republic Act 2786, separated from its mother province, Surigao, on September 18, 1960.
At the time of its inception, it was classified as 4th Class province with an annual income of over ₱300,000.00..Seven years later, because of rapid increase of revenue collection particularly from the logging ventures, it has been reclassified as Ist Class B and in 1980 as Ist Class A with an estimated annual income of around ₱13,000,000..It has been reclassified as 2nd Class with a revenue adding up to ₱315,888,300.63.
Recaredo B. Castillo was the appointed first governor and subsequently elected governor while Vicente L. Pimentel was the first elected congressman.
The province was formed with 13 municipalities..Six more were added, raising the number to 19 with Tandag as the capital..Two of its municipalities have been elevated to cities; the first was Bislig City.
Contemporary
The capital town Tandag became a component city by virtue of Republic Act No..9392 which sought to convert the town into a city..The law was ratified on June 23, 2007..However, the cityhood status was lost twice in the years 2008 and 2010 after the LCP questioned the validity of the cityhood law..The cityhood status was reaffirmed after the court finalized its ruling on February 15, 2011 which declared the cityhood law constitutional.
House Bill No..2336 of the 19th Congress seeks to separate the southern part of the province to be formed as the new Province of Surigao Oriental.

The Surigaonon and Tandaganon languages are spoken in most parts of Surigao del Sur (except in Bislig and the towns of Barobo, Hinatuan, Lingig and Tagbina, where most of the inhabitants speak Cebuano and their native Kamayo, a different language but one distantly related to Surigaonon, is spoken by the rest of the population), with the Cantilangnon dialect, a northern variety of Surigaonon that is very much similar to the dialect of Surigaonon as spoken in Surigao del Norte, being spoken mostly in the five northern municipalities of the province, namely Carrascal, Cantilan, Madrid, Carmen and Lanuza (or the municipal cluster called Carcanmadcarlan); these municipalities were once under a single Municipality of Cantilan before December 10, 1918.
Tagalog and English are also widely spoken throughout the province and used as the primary languages of education, business, and administration.

Tarlac, officially the Province of Tarlac (Kapampangan: Lalawigan ning Tarlac; Pangasinan: Luyag/Probinsia na Tarlac; Ilocano: Probinsia ti Tarlac; Tagalog: Lalawigan ng Tarlac; ), is a landlocked province in the Philippines located in the Central Luzon region..Its capital is the city of Tarlac..It is bounded on the north by the province of Pangasinan, Nueva Ecija on the east, Zambales on the west, and Pampanga in the south..The province comprises three congressional districts and is subdivided into 17 municipalities and one city, Tarlac City, which is the provincial capital.
The province is situated in the heartland of Luzon, in what is known as the Central Plain also spanning the neighbouring provinces of Pampanga, Pangasinan, Nueva Ecija, and Zambales..Tarlac covers a total land area of 3,053.45 km2 (305,345 ha).
Early in history, what came to be known as Valenzuela Ranch today was once a thickly-forested area, peopled by roving tribes of nomadic Aetas who are said to be the aboriginal settlers of the Philippines, and for a lengthy period, it was the remaining hinterland of Luzon's Central Plains..Today, Tarlac is one of the most multi-cultural provinces in the region for having a mixture of four distinct ethnic groups: the Kapampangans, the Pangasinans, the Ilocanos, and the Tagalogs..It is also known for its fine food and vast sugar and rice plantations in Central Luzon.

Spanish colonial era
Tarlac's name is a Hispanized derivation from a talahib weed called Malatarlak, a Pangasinan term..Tarlac was originally divided into two parts: the southern division belonging to Pampanga and the northern division belonging to Pangasinan..It was the last province in Central Luzon to be organized under the Spanish colonial administration in 1874..Its nucleus were the towns of Concepcion, Capas, Bamban, Mabalacat, Magalang, Porac, Floridablanca, Victoria, and Tarlac which constituted a military comandancia..Some of these municipalities were returned to Pampanga but the rest were incorporated into the new province of Tarlac.
Unlike other provinces in Central Luzon, Tarlac was relatively free from revolts during the Spanish regime before the late 1800s rose..Only the rebellion started by Juan de la Cruz Palaris in Pangasinan spread to the northern portion of Tarlac.
Philippine revolution
During the Philippine Revolution of 1896, Tarlac was among the first eight provinces to rise against Spain, alongside neighbouring Pampanga..It became the new seat of the first Philippine Republic in March 1899 when General Emilio Aguinaldo abandoned the former capital, Malolos, Bulacan..This lasted only for a month before the seat was moved to Nueva Ecija in Aguinaldo's attempt to elude the pursuing Americans.
American invasion era
On October 23, 1899, Gregorio Aglipay, military vicar general of the revolutionary forces, called the Filipino clergy to a conference in Paniqui..There, they drafted the constitution of the Philippine Independent Church..They called for the Filipinization of the clergy, which eventually led to a separation from the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines.
Tarlac was captured by American forces in November 1899..A civil government was established in the province in 1901.
Japanese occupation era
During World War II, Camp O'Donnell in Capas became the terminal point of the infamous Bataan Death March of Filipino and American soldiers who surrendered at Bataan on April 9, 1942..Many prisoners died of hunger, disease and/or execution..The general headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army was established from January 3, 1942, to June 30, 1946, and the 3rd Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was founding again from October 28, 1944, to June 30, 1946, and military stationed in the province of Tarlac and some parts in Central Luzon due to Japanese Occupation.
In early 1945, combined American and Filipino military forces with the recognized Aringay Command guerrillas liberated Camp O'Donnell..The raid in Capas resulted in the rescue of American, Filipino and other allied Prisoners of War.
From January 20, 1945, to August 15, 1945, Tarlac was recaptured by combined Filipino and American troops together with the recognized guerrilla fighters against the Japanese Imperial forces during the liberation and beginning for the Battle of Tarlac under the Luzon Campaign.
Postwar era
After the social and economic upheavals of the war and with government institutions still in their nascent form after the recognition of Philippine Independence by the international community, the first few decades after the end of the war were marked by dissatisfaction and social tension.
The Filipino communist Hukbalahap guerrilla movement formed by the farmers of Central Luzon to fight the Japanese occupation, had found themselves sidelined by the new post-independence Philippine government which had taken up the fear of communist influence which marked the beginning of the cold war in the west..So they decided to extended their fight into a rebellion against the new government, only to be put down through a series of reforms and military victories by Defense Secretary, and later President, Ramon Magsaysay.
Ultimately more effective than those who took up arms were the numerous political and labor movements who kept working towards agricultural land reform and stronger labor rights, with laborers' and farmers' protests gathering enough steam that several Philippine presidents were forced to meet with them and then concede to their demands..Among the most successful of these  were the Land Justice March of the political group known as the Filipino Agrarian Reform Movement (FARM), which intended to march from Tarlac to Malacañang in 1969, although President Marcos was forced to give in to their demands early, meeting them while they were still at Camp Servillano Aquino in Tarlac City itself.
During the Marcos dictatorship
The beginning months of the 1970s marked a period of turmoil and change in the Philippines, as well as in Tarlac.
With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years.
Martial Law had immediate political impacts in Tarlac, since political leaders who were critical of Marcos were immediately jailed..This included Senator and Concepcion native Ninoy Aquino, and Bamban Mayor Pedro D. Mendiola  who was imprisoned in Camp Crame..Other Tarlaqueño Marcos critics who had roles in government, such as Development Academy of the Philippines (DAP) executive vice president Horacio Morales, tried to stay so they could pursue change from within, but eventually could not reconcile themselves with the idea of working within the dictatorship..were killed in various encounters with Marcos' forces.
Ninoy Aquino was eventually assassinated in August 1983, igniting protests throughout the Philippines which would eventually force Marcos to announce a snap election in February 1986..Even then, those who resisted Marcos were targetted for death, such as in the case of oppositionist campaign organizer Jeremias De Jesus political organizer, who was assassinated shortly before elections

Rice plantations in Gerona
The economy of Tarlac is predominantly agricultural..It is among the biggest producers of rice and sugarcane (the principal crops) in Central Luzon..Other major crops are corn and coconuts, fruits (bananas, calamansi and mangoes) and vegetables (eggplants, garlic and onions).
Because the province is landlocked, its fish production is limited to fishpens, but it has vast river systems and irrigation..On the Zambales boundary to its west, forest land provides timber for the logging industry..Mineral reserves such as manganese and iron can also be found along the western section.
Tarlac has its own rice and corn mills, sawmills and logging outfits..It has three sugar-refining centrals and hosts many sugar products in Central Luzon, especially the Muscovado sugar of the municipality of Victoria..Other firms service agricultural needs such as fertilizers..Among its cottage industries, ceramics has become available because of the abundant supply of clay..Some of the major industries here involve making chicharon (pork skin chips) and iniruban in the municipality of Camiling and Ilang-Ilang products of Anao..Tilapia production is also improving in Tarlac, with an aim to make the province the second ""Tilapia Capital of Central Luzon"" after its mother province, Pampanga.
Culture
Belenismo sa Tarlac
Belenismo sa Tarlac was launched by Isabel Cojuangco-Suntay, sister of former Ambassador Eduardo Cojuangco Jr., to transform the province into the Belén Capital of the Philippines..The Belen Festival began in September 2007, with the first Belen-making workshop conducted on December 16, 2007..Organizers have intended the festival to become an annual event in the province..Senator Loren Legarda led the awarding of the first Belen-making competition where Tarlac PNP Office Belen, built by at least 24 policemen, won the first prize.
Belenismo in Spanish means the art of making Belén, a representation of the Nativity scene in which the Holy Family (Joseph, Mary and the infant Jesus) is visited by the three wise men who came to the manger through the guidance of a star.
Chicharon Iniruban Festival
It is a festivity that is yearly celebrated in the town of Camiling during the last week of October..It is intended as a preparation for All Saints' Day and a Thanksgiving Celebration for the good harvest and for the good quality of meat products especially the chicharon or Bagnet..It also features the exotic and delicious rice cake Iniruban, as called by Ilocanos..The festival's highlights are the street dancing competition, Miss Iniruban beauty pageant, and the municipality's agri-trade..It is the oldest cultural celebration in the province introduced in 2000.
Provincial capital
The highest seat of political power of the province is located on a hill in Barangay San Vicente, Tarlac City..The present structure was finished in 1909..During the Japanese occupation, the provincial capitol was vacated and used as the provincial headquarters of the Imperial Army..The capitol suffered great damages during the Second World War, but afterwards, in 1946, the United States of America helped rebuild and improve its structure..Because of its historical background, the picture of the capitol façade appeared in the previous version of the 500 peso bill.

Tawi-Tawi, officially the Province of Tawi-Tawi (Tausug: Wilaya' sin Tawi-Tawi; Sinama: Jawi Jawi/Jauih Jauih; Tagalog: Lalawigan ng Tawi-Tawi), is an island province in the Philippines located in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM)..The capital of Tawi-Tawi is Bongao.
It is the southernmost province of the country, sharing sea borders with the Malaysian state of Sabah and the Indonesian North Kalimantan province, both on the island of Borneo to the west..To the northeast lies the province of Sulu..Tawi-Tawi also covers some islands in the Sulu Sea to the northwest, Cagayan de Tawi-Tawi Island and the Turtle Islands, just 20 kilometres (12 mi) away from Sabah.
The municipalities comprising the current Tawi-Tawi province were formerly under the jurisdiction of Sulu until 1973.
Etymology
The province was named after its main island..Tawi-Tawi is the Sinama form of jawi-jawi, Malay for the banyan tree;
History
Early history
Evidence of human presence in Tawi-tawi was carbon-dated to be 6,810 BC to 3,190 B.C., signifying one of the earliest known evidence of human presence in Southeast Asia..The bones, jars, shells, and other artifacts and fossils were found in the Bolobok Rock Shelter Cave Archaeological Site, which has been declared as an Important Cultural Treasure by the government in 2017.
Much of the Tawi-tawi area was the center of Sama culture and arts for hundreds of years..Some islands are sites of centuries-old traditional burial grounds featuring traditional Sama okil carvings of ancestors.
In 1380, the first mosque in the Philippines, the Sheik Karimol Makhdum Mosque, was established by an Arab trader and missionary, Makhdum Karim..The area was heavily converted to Islam, especially when the Sultanate of Sulu in nearby Sulu province was founded..Although unlike the Tausug people, many Sama retained at least part of their ancient animist religions.
Spanish colonial era
As early as January 28, 1761, Sultan Muizz ud-Din entered into an agreement with Alexander Dalrymple of the British East India Company for commercial and economic concessions..The subsequent treaties with Muizz ud-Din on September 12, 1762, and with Sultan Azim ud-Din, claimant to the Sultanate and a prisoner of the British in Manila, on February 23, 1763, confirmed these British claims..However, on March 5, 1775, Datu Teteng annihilated the British troops in Balambangan..Since then, the Muslims not only fought the British soldiers but also the Spanish troops..After the brother of Sultan Aliyud-Din I captured the Spanish ship San Jose in Tawi-Tawi, the British forces withdrew from Balambangan in 1805.
On January 22, 1878, Baron von Overbeck, representing the British North Borneo Company, signed a treaty with Sultan Jamalul Alam for the lease of the Sultan's land in Borneo at an annual rent of 5,000 Mexican dollars..The Germans also asked for commercial concessions..Due to foreign encroachments, the Spaniards constructed a naval base at Tata'an and built garrisons in Bongao and Siasi.
On March 7, 1885, Spain, Britain and Germany signed a protocol in Madrid whereby Spain relinquished all her claims to the offshore lands in Borneo, granted freedom of trade and navigation in Sulu, and Britain and Germany recognized Spanish sovereignty over Balabac and Cagayan de Sulu..However, the British diplomatically continued to pay the annual rents for Sabah (Sultan's land in Borneo) to Harun ar-Rashid.
During the Philippine Revolution of 1896, the mutiny of the 68th Regiment at Busbus, Jolo implicated Tagalog soldiers..The Muslims, however, retained their own views on independence and freedom.
American invasion era
When the American forces occupied Jolo on May 19, 1899, they established garrisons at Bongao and Siasi after the Muslims wiped out the Spanish garrison in Tata'an, Tawi-Tawi..In 1900, the United States entered into a treaty with Spain whereby Sibutu and Cagayan de Sulu were ceded to the former for $100,000..The Sultanate continued to receive the rentals for Sabah until 1946 when the British North Borneo Company sold its rights to the British Crown.
Japanese occupation era
During World War II, the calm but exposed waters around the islands were used by the Imperial Japanese Navy as a major fleet anchorage due to its proximity to the oilfields of Borneo..Japanese forces, however, did not develop any facilities on the islands leaving the anchorage without an airfield, which allowed American submarines to track the movements of the Japanese fleet at the exposed anchorage.
On October 16, 1947, the offshore lands of Borneo—Taganak, Bakkungan, Bayaua, Sibauang and Lihiman Islands—were turned over to the Philippines by the British North Borneo government..The unveiling ceremonies of the marker in Taganak Island on June 26, 1948, were attended by M.G..Combe, representing Great Britain, former President Diosdado Macapagal for the Philippines, Princess Tarhata Kiram for the Sultanate, and Governor Kalingalan Caluang for Sulu.
Philippine Independence
Foundation
Previously part of the province of Sulu, Tawi-Tawi was converted into a province on September 11, 1973, pursuant to Presidential Decree No..302
Prior to issuing the decree, President Marcos had asked Espaldon, “Why are the young boys of Tawi-Tawi easily wooed by the Moro National Liberation Front?” Espaldon replied, “The Sama boys, like their elders and leaders, are tired and weary of their union with the Province of Sulu..They want to have their own leaders and manage their own affairs..If His Excellency wants to solve the problem, I recommend that he create them into a separate province and allow them to exercise their own local prerogatives.” Hence, Espaldon earned the moniker ""Father of Tawi-Tawi.""
During the first 730 days of Tawi-Tawi as a province, Espaldon spearheaded over 100 civilian infrastructure projects, including the construction of the provincial capitol, provincial hospital, public market, 50 mosques, school houses, radio station, airstrips, piers, houses, bridges, roads and water system.
The seat of the provincial government was initially designated as Bato-Bato in the municipality of Balimbing (now Panglima Sugala),
Contemporary
Tawi-Tawi is currently being groomed as the location of a special economic zone and transhipment point, a future center of commerce as the Tawi-Tawi freeport is being built in the area.
Geography
Bud Bongao, a 250-hectare (2.5 km2) mountain-forest and sacred mountain of Tawi-Tawi
The province lies at the southwestern tip of the country, situated between the Sulu Sea in the north and the Celebes Sea in the south..The province is part of the Sulu Archipelago, and consists of Tawitawi Island and 106 surrounding islands and islets with a combined land area of 1,087.4 square kilometres (419.8 square miles)..The last island of the province at the edge of the Philippine-Malaysia border is Panguan Island.
The province has two seasons: dry and wet..The climate is generally moderate..The wettest months are from August to November..The other months of the year are generally dry with occasional rain showers.
Biogeography
The main island of Tawi-Tawi supports many endemic species and subspecies of vertebrates, invertebrates and plants unique to this island, plus some that are only shared with Sulu Province..These include the Tawitawi brown dove, the Sulu hornbill and the Sulu bleeding-heart, although this latter species may already be extinct.
The rapid expansion of human settlements into forested areas together with clearance for agriculture in the last few decades has dramatically reduced the available habitat for most of the endemic species, many of which are now considered 'Critically Endangered' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.
Administrative divisions

The population of Tawi-Tawi in the 2020 census was 440,276 people, with a density of 400 inhabitants per square kilometre or 1,000 inhabitants per square mile.
Inhabitants
This article needs attention from an expert in Philippines..See the talk page for details..WikiProject Philippines may be able to help recruit an expert..(June 2014)
Most of the people in Tawi-Tawi belong to the Sama cultural group..Within this group are subgroups and named based on the location of the speaker..Sama Sibutu are those from the Sibutu-Sitangkai Island Group, Sama Simunul are those from Simunul-Manuk Mangkaw Island Group, and so on.
The Jama Mapun are largely found in the Cagayan Mapun and Turtle Island Group..Many of the people from the Turtle Islands and Cagayan Mapun maintain daily commerce with Sabah, since it is only 14 kilometers away.
The Badjao (also called ""Sama Dilaut"") are widely dispersed across the province, though their population is diminishing due to diseases and migration to other areas in the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.
The Tausog or Tau Sug, Orang Suluk or Aa Suk are a Moro ethnic group constituting a significant minority in Tawi-Tawi.
Language
The Tausug language is the lingua franca of Tawi-Tawi, as in the case of the rest of the provinces in the Sulu Archipelago..Another prevailing local language, Sama, is spoken in varied tones and accents with the major ones being Sinama Sibutu (spoken mainly in the Sibutu-Sitangkai Region), Sinama Simunul (concentrated in Simunul-Manuk-Mangkaw Islands), Sinama Kapoan (spoken in the South Ubian-Tandubas and Sapa-Sapa Regions) and Sinama Banguingui (concentrated in Buan Island and spoken by Banguingui people).
Chavacano, Cebuano, and Yakan are also spoken, as are the official languages of Filipino and English..Many locals and barter traders can also speak Sabah Malay.
Many can also speak Cebuano because of the mass influx of Visayan settlers to Mindanao, since Tausug is a related Visayan language.
Religion
Almost all (99%) of the population of Tawi-Tawi is Muslim, with a minority of Christians (0.7%).
A majority of Tawi-Tawi's Muslim population practice Sunni Islam of the Shafi'i tradition, as taught by Arab, Persian, Indian Muslim, Chinese Muslim and Malaccan missionaries from the 14th century onwards..The oldest mosque in the Philippines, the Sheik Karimol Makdum Mosque, can be found in Simunul, Tawi-Tawi.
Relatively newer Islamic sects, mostly brought by returning veterans of the Afghan wars and missionaries from Pakistan's stricter Sufi traditions, referred to as the Tableegh, have been active in propagating what they believe to be a ""purer"" Islamic way of life and worship..A very small number who have since married into Iranian or Iraqi families have converted to Shiite Islam.
Majority of Tawi-Tawi Christians are Roman Catholic, they are under the jurisdiction of Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zamboanga through its suffragan Apostolic Vicariate of Jolo/Diocese of Jolo..Non-Catholic Christians include Evangelicals, Jesus Miracle Crusade, Episcopalian, and Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), Mormons, Seventh-day Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and a number of other Protestant denominations..Only the most recent Chinese immigrants adhere to Buddhism or Taoism, while most of the older Chinese families have acculturated and have either converted to Islam while retaining most of their Chinese beliefs.

Agriculture, fishing, and agar-agar (seaweeds) farming are the leading source of livelihood of the people of Tawi-Tawi, with quite a number engaged in the barter trade business..Copra is the top agricultural product, followed by root crops, fruits, and vegetables.
Transportation
Sanga-Sanga Airport, the main airport of the province, is located in the municipality of Bongao.
Recently, Philippine Airlines and Bangsamoro Government launches the inaugural flight of the first ever regional air connectivity on June 9, 2022, from Cotabato City, the regions seat and capital..Meanwhile, Cebu Pacific began operating a daily flight from Zamboanga City to Tawi-Tawi Province on October 14, 2011, utilizing its 150-seater Airbus A319 aircraft..Philippine Airlines (operated by PAL Express) also started operating flights to and from Zamboanga City on December 15, 2019.
A sea connection to other parts of the Philippine archipelago as well as an international route to Semporna, Malaysia is available from Bongao.

Zambales, officially the Province of Zambales (Sambal: Probinsya nin Zambales; Ilocano: Probinsia ti Zambales; Pangasinan: Luyag/Probinsia na Zambales; Filipino: Lalawigan ng Zambales), is a province in the Philippines located in the Central Luzon region..Its capital is Iba, which is located in the middle of the province..Olongapo is the largest city of the province wherein it is geographically located but politically independent.
Zambales borders Pangasinan to the north and northeast, Tarlac to the east, Pampanga to the southeast, Bataan to the south and the South China Sea to the west..With a total land area of 3,830.83 square kilometres (1,479.09 sq mi) (including the independent city of Olongapo), Zambales is the second largest among the seven provinces of Central Luzon after Nueva Ecija..The province is noted for its mangoes, which are abundant from January to April.
Zambales does not have a functional airport; the closest functional airport is Clark International Airport in Angeles City in the neighbouring province of Pampanga..Subic Bay International Airport, which is located in Cubi Point (geographically located inside Morong, Bataan) in the Subic Bay Freeport Zone is no longer functional for domestic and international flights.
The Freeport Zone (SBFZ) is host to many tourist attractions which include casinos, parks, malls, beach-side huts, cottages and resorts, as well as historical sites.
Etymology
The name of the province is derived from ""Zambales"", the Hispanized name of the Sambal people..The Sambal were the original dominant ethnic group of the region.
History
Zambales map in 1918
Spanish colonial era
The Spanish first explored the area in 1572, led by Juan de Salcedo..Zambales was originally derived from 2 parts: the southern area from Pampanga and the northern area from Pangasinan.
During the Spanish period, a 1774 map was made, which clearly named Scarborough Shoals as Panacot Shoal, a feature under complete sovereignty of Spanish Philippines, specifically of Zambales..The shoal's current name was chosen by Captain Philip D'Auvergne, whose East India Company East Indiaman Scarborough briefly grounded on one of the rocks on September 12, 1784, before sailing on to China..When the Philippines was granted independence in the 19th century and 20th century, Scarborough Shoal was passed by the colonial governments to the sovereign Republic of the Philippines..: 31, 54, 113
American invasion era
Masinloc became the province's first capital..However, the capital was moved among the last three towns above during its history before finally settling in Iba, due to its strategic location..Seven of the province's original northern towns, which included Bolinao, Infanta, San Isidro, now Burgos, Anda, Bani, Agno and Alaminos were later transferred under the jurisdiction of Pangasinan because of their distance from the capital..The first civil governor of Zambales during the colonial American era was Potenciano Lesaca from 1901 to 1903.
Postwar Era
Under a 1947 Military Bases Agreement,
During the Marcos dictatorship
Main articles: Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos and Human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship
The beginning months of the 1970s marked a period of turmoil and change in the Philippines, as well as in Zambales.
With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years.
In Olongapo, the continuation of the Vietnam war through this period meant the arrival of a constantly growing number of U.S..Sailors to Subic Naval Base, and along with it, the rapid growth of prostitution.
In 1986, the province was one of the main supporters of the People Power Revolution in Manila, which topped the 21-year dictatorship and installed Corazon Aquino as president, bringing back democracy to the country.
Later 20th Century
The province was heavily affected by the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo..Due to this, the economy of the province weakened for some time, but regained vitality a few years after the government ordered the revitalization of the province and established growth in its southern towns, which later became a significant economic zone in the country by 1995.
Contemporary
The 2012 Scarborough Shoal standoff led to a situation where access to the shoal was restricted by the People's Republic of China.
In 2018, it was revealed that for every 3,000 peso worth of fish catch by Sambal fisherfolks, China siphoned them in exchange for 'two bottles of mineral water' worth 20 pesos.
Geography
Western coastline of the province featuring several coves
The Zambales Mountains seen from San Antonio
Zambales lies on the western shores of Luzon island along the South China Sea..Its shoreline is rugged and features many coves and inlets..The Zambales Mountains in the eastern length of the province occupies about 60% of the total land area of Zambales..Subic Bay, at the southern end of the province, provides a natural harbor, and was the location of the U.S..Naval Base Subic Bay until its closure in 1992.
The summit and crater lake of Mount Pinatubo lies within Botolan municipality in Zambales, near the tripoint of Zambales, Pampanga and Tarlac provinces..after being buried by more than 20 feet (6.1 m) of lahar.
Climate
Zambales has two pronounced seasons: dry from October to June, and wet from July to September.
Administrative divisions
Zambales comprises 13 municipalities and 1 highly urbanized city, which are divided into two legislative districts..Olongapo City is a highly urbanized city and administers itself autonomously from the province..Panatag Shoal (Scarborough Shoal) a Philippine-claimed territory, is a designated part of the province.
The northern half of the province typically comprises the municipalities of Santa Cruz, Candelaria, Masinloc, and Palauig..The central half of the province consists of the municipalities of Iba (the capital), Botolan, Cabangan, and San Felipe..The southern half of the province is composed of the municipalities of San Narciso, San Marcelino, San Antonio, Castillejos, Subic, and the highly urbanized city of Olongapo.

The historical province of Zamboanga in 1918
Prior to its creation as a province, Zamboanga del Norte formed the northern portion of the historical province of Zamboanga.
The early history of Zamboanga del Norte is shared with that of Zamboanga City, which had been the center of the entire Mindanao area, most notably during the American era..When Zamboanga City became a chartered city on October 12, 1936, it encompassed the southern tip of the Zamboanga Peninsula and the island of Basilan, making it the largest city in the world in terms of land area.
Philippine independence
Foundation
Through Republic Act No..711 issued on June 6, 1952, Zamboanga province was divided into two independent provinces, which included Zamboanga del Sur.

Contemporary
Proposed carving out of new province
In 2017, House Bill No..5040 was introduced in the House of Representatives seeking to carve out a new province from Zamboanga del Norte..The proposed Zamboanga Hermosa province was to consist of 12 municipalities and 2 legislative districts that make up the 3rd legislative district of Zamboanga del Norte: Baliguian, Godod, Gutalac, Kalawit, Labason, Leon B. Postigo, Liloy (its proposed capital), Salug, Sibuco, Siocon, Sirawai, and Tampilisan..However, the bill ultimately did not pass the 17th congress.
In 2023, a new House Bill 9311 proposed a creation of a new province, Zamboanga Occidental..The proposed province is supposed to include twelve  municipalities: Leon B. Postigo, Salug, Godod, Liloy, Tampilisan, Kalawit, Labason, Gutalac, Baliguian, Siocon, Sirawai, and Sibuco.

Zamboanga del Sur (Cebuano: Habagatang Zamboanga; Subanen: S'helatan Sembwangan/Sembwangan dapit Shelatan; Maguindanaon: Salatan Sambuangan, Jawi: سلاتن سامبواڠن; Filipino: Katimugang Zamboanga), officially the Province of Zamboanga del Sur, is a province in the Philippines located in the Zamboanga Peninsula region in Mindanao..Its capital is the city of Pagadian.
Statistically grouped with Zamboanga del Sur is the highly urbanized City of Zamboanga, which is geographically separated and a chartered city and governed independently from the province and also its largest city.
The province borders Zamboanga del Norte to the north, Zamboanga Sibugay to the west, Misamis Occidental to the northeast, and Lanao del Norte to the east..To the south is the Moro Gulf.
Etymology
The name of Zamboanga is the Hispanicized spelling of the Sinama term for ""mooring place"" - samboangan (also spelled sambuangan; and in Subanen, sembwangan), from the root word samboang (""mooring pole"")..""Samboangan"" was the original name of Zamboanga City, from where the name of the peninsula is derived from.
This is commonly contested by folk etymologies which instead attribute the name of Zamboanga to the  Indonesian word jambangan (claimed to mean ""place of flowers"", but actually means ""pot"" or ""bowl""), usually with claims that all ethnic groups in Zamboanga were ""Malays""..However, this name has never been attested in any historical records prior to the 1960s.
History
Further information: Zamboanga (province) and Moro Province
The historical province of Zamboanga in 1918.
Early history
The original inhabitants of the Zamboanga Peninsula were the Maguindanaon and Subanen, who settled along the riverbanks in inland areas; and the various Sama-Bajau and Yakan ethnic groups who settled in coastal areas..Tausūg settlers from northeastern Mindanao also migrated to the region in the 13th century.
The region was additionally settled by migrants (mostly from the Visayas islands) after World War II..Together with the original settlers, these pioneers helped develop Zamboanga del Sur into the abundant and culturally diverse province that it is.
American invasion era
Historically, Zamboanga was the capital of the Moro Province in western Mindanao, which comprised five districts: Cotabato, Davao, Sulu, Lanao, and Zamboanga..In 1940, these districts became individual provinces..Zamboanga City became the capital of Zamboanga province.
Philippine independence
Soon after World War II, the provincial capital was transferred to Dipolog..Molave was created as the provincial capital in 1948.
Foundation
On June 6, 1952, through Republic Act No..711, Zamboanga del Sur was carved out from the former Zamboanga province that encompassed the entire peninsula in southwestern Mindanao..As the 52nd province of the Philippines, it originally consisted of 11 towns with the City of Zamboanga and the Island of Basilan, which were later expanded into 42 municipalities with the City of Pagadian as the capital.
This happened in the midst of the postwar period, a time when Mindanao was peaceful and increasingly progressive..Ethnic tensions were minimal, and there was essentially no presence of secessionists groups in Mindanao.
The Marcos era
Main articles: Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos, Ilaga, Jabidah massacre, and Moro conflict
The late 1960s in Mindanao saw a rise in land dispute conflicts arising from the influx of settlers from Luzon and Visayas,
The September 1972 declaration of Martial Law began a 14-year period historically remembered for its human rights abuses,
The year 1982 was a particularly bloody year for Zamboanga del Sur under the Marcos dictatorship, as two massacres happened in the province that year..On February 12, 1982, members of the Ilaga killed 12 persons in Dumingag, Zamboanga del Sur, allegedly to avenge the death of their leader, who they believed had been killed by the NPA.
Contemporary
Separation of Zamboanga Sibugay
Political developments in February 2001 saw another major change in the territorial jurisdiction of Zamboanga del Sur..Its inhabitants voted to create a new province out of the third congressional district, named Zamboanga Sibugay.
Geography
Zamboanga del Sur covers a total area of 4,499.46 square kilometres (1,737.25 sq mi) The province is bordered on the north by Zamboanga del Norte, west by Zamboanga Sibugay, northeast by Misamis Occidental, east by Lanao del Norte, southeast by Illana Bay, and south by the Moro Gulf.
Topography
Dao Dao islands within the Yllana Bay
Stretching northward from Sibugay in the southwest and running along the northern boundary to Salug Valley in the east is the province’s mountainous countryside..The coastal plains extend regularly from south to west then spread into wide flat lands when reaching the coastal plains of the Baganian peninsula in the southeast.
The longest river in Region IX, the Sibugay River gets its water from the mountains of Zamboanga del Sur most specifically in Bayog and Lakewood, from where it flows into Sibuguey Bay which is now part of Zamboanga Sibugay..Other notable rivers are the Kumalarang River, the Dinas River with its headwaters in the Mount Timolan Protected Landscape, and Salug River in Molave.
Climate
The province has a relatively high mean annual rainfall: 1,599 to 3,500 millimetres (63.0 to 137.8 in)..Temperature is relatively warm and constant throughout the year: 22 to 35 °C (72 to 95 °F).

Further information: Zamboanga (province) and 2001 Zamboanga Sibugay creation plebiscite
The earliest recorded mention of Sibugay was in Historia de las islas de Mindanao, Jolo y sus adyacentes (1667) by the Spanish priest Francisco Combés, which describes the village of ""Sibuguey"" along the river Sibuguey.
Zamboanga Sibugay was formerly part of Zamboanga del Sur..Attempts to divide Zamboanga del Sur into two separate provinces date as far back as the 1960s..Several bills were filed in the Philippine Congress, but remained unacted.
It started in the 1960s when several bills were filed in Congress such as House Bill No..17574 by the late Rep. Vincenzo Sagun, HB No..8546 of Congresswoman Belma Cabilao, HB No..341 through Congressman Vicente M. Cerilles and the Batasan Parliamentary Bill sponsored by parliament members (Antonio Ceniza, Manuel M. Espaldon, Hussien Loong, Kalbi Tupay, and Minister Romulo Espaldon)..All of these bills were relegated to the recesses of the archives.
In 1993, an initiative called the Zamboanga Occidental Movement ushered in a renewed political consciousness among the people of the 3rd district of Zamboanga del Sur..The movement was so intense that a People’s Initiative was conducted simultaneously with the May 1997 Barangay Elections..In this exercise, majority of the voters signed in favor of forming a new province..It was then that Congressman George T. Hofer sponsored HB No..1311..He managed to push the bill in Congress and gave it a new identity by naming the proposed province as Zamboanga Sibugay..He lobbied for its approval in the senate and the new province was finally created by Republic Act No..8973 signed into law by President Joseph Estrada on November 7, 2000..On February 22, 2001, R.A. 8973 was ratified through a plebiscite conducted in 44 municipalities of Zamboanga del Sur and Pagadian City..Zamboanga del Sur Third District Representative George Hofer was appointed and later elected as its first governor in 2001.

Metropolitan Manila it is composed of sixteen highly urbanized cities: the capital city, Manila, Caloocan, Las Piñas, Makati, Malabon, Mandaluyong, Marikina, Muntinlupa, Navotas, Parañaque, Pasay, Pasig, Quezon City, San Juan, Taguig, and Valenzuela, along with one independent municipality, Pateros..As the second most populous and the most densely populated region in the Philippines, it ranks as the 9th most populous metropolitan area in Asia and the 6th most populous urban area in the world.
The region is the center of culture (including arts and entertainment), economy, education and government of the Philippines..Designated as a global power city, the region exerts a significant impact on commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, both locally and internationally..It is the home to all embassies in the Philippines, thereby making it an important center for international diplomacy in the country..Its economic power makes the region the country's premier center for finance and commerce..The region accounts for 36% of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Philippines..Greater Manila is the fourth largest ASEAN country subdivision by GDP after Singapore, Jakarta and Bangkok.
In 1975, in response to the need to sustain and provide integrated services to the growing population, the built-up area centered on Manila was formally recognized as a metropolitan area through Presidential Decree No..824.

Further information: Capital of the Philippines
Kingdom of Luzon
Manila, to the extent that it has this placename, was likely founded in the Middle Ages, or between 400 and 1500s, due to the Sanskrit origin of the component ""nila"" in its name which refers to ""indigo"", and the prevalence of the placename during the rule of Raja Matanda, the old King of Luzon, who was born in the early 1500s..The earliest evidence of Hinduism and Sanskrit influence in maritime Southeast Asia is in Sanskrit inscriptions from the late 300s in eastern Kalimantan (or Borneo)..This analysis of the placename is supported by many other nearby placenames in the Tagalog region with the prefix ""may-""..As for Luzon, what is now considered Luzon island, or at least its southern portion, was called ""Luzon the greater"", while what is now considered Mindoro island was called ""Luzon the lesser"".
Manila has historically been a global city due to its role for international trade..By the 15th and 16th centuries, Manila was a walled and fortified city and was the capital of the Kingdom of Luzon..Its institution, government, and economy were associated with the Tagalogs and the Kapampangans, and the Malay language was extensively used for foreign affairs as customary in much of Southeast Asia at the time..It was also well known by other Southeast Asian kingdoms such as Cebu, Brunei, Melaka, other Malay kingdoms, and Ternate, and may be known in East Asia as far as China and Japan.
In the current territory of Metropolitan Manila, there were several lordships that were either sovereign or tributary such as Tondo (Tundók),  Malate (Maalát), Navotas (Nabútas), Tambobong (Tambúbong), Taguig (Tagiig), Parañaque (Palanyág), Cainta (Kay Intâ), and Pateros.
Shortly after Raja Matanda's birth, sometime around the early 1500s while he was raja muda or heir apparent, his father, the King of Luzon, died, leaving his mother as Queen Regent of Luzon..By 1511, Luzonians had been carrying out large-scale trade at least within maritime Southeast Asia with some Luzonians being hired as officials in Melaka and some Luzonian merchants gaining royal favors in Brunei..It was in Melaka that Luzonians met the Portuguese before the Portuguese conquest of Melaka in 1511..In 1521, Raja Matanda, then still a young man, was known in maritime Southeast Asia as the son of the King of Luzon..He married a princess of Brunei and served as an admiral for his grandfather, the Sultan of Brunei, in an attack near Java in exchange for soldiers and a fleet of ships..On the way home, he met and had an encounter with a Castilian fleet.
Some Luzonians in the 1500s had also been taking part in mercenary work in other kingdoms..The Luzonians' commercial influence also reached as far as Butuan..By the 1570s, the ruling class of Manila together with the international Luzonian merchants were Muslim and Islam was spreading through the freemen and the slaves.
On May 24, 1570, the battle of Manila was fought between the Kingdom of Luzon, under the command of the heir apparent Prince Sulayman, and the Kingdom of the Spains and the Indies, under the command of field marshal Martin de Goiti who was aided by some foreign forces..This resulted in the arson and destruction of Manila.
Spanish rule

A map of the province of Manila during Spanish rule
After destroying Manila, the Spanish set up a settlement to secure territory on the same site on the Luzon island for the Spanish ruler..Initially enclosed in wood, much later in stone, a new walled city of Manila became the capital of the Spanish East Indies..After setting up a settlement and consolidating some territorial holdings outwards, the Spanish instituted a province known as Manila.
Later on, the Manila galleon continually sailed the Pacific from end-to-end, bringing to Mexico Asian merchandise and cultural exchange.
First Philippine Republic
In the First Philippine Republic, the province included the walled city of Manila and 23 other municipalities..Mariquina also served as the provincial capital from 1898 to 1899..However, despite almost the entirety of the territory being occupied by Philippine forces, the walled city of Manila was occupied by Spanish forces.

American rule
Creation of the province of Rizal
During American rule, the province was dissolved and most of it was incorporated into the newly created province of Rizal on June 11, 1901, by Act No..137.
Manila in 1901 was composed of Binondo, Ermita, Intramuros, Malate, Manila, Pandacan, Quiapo, Sampaloc, San Andrés Bukid, San Fernando de Dilao, San Miguel, San Nicolas, Santa Ana de Sapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Mesa, and Tondo.
Philippine Commonwealth
In the Philippine Commonwealth, the American architect Daniel Burnham was commissioned to propose a Plan of Manila for the Philippine government.
In the current territory of Metropolitan Manila, the towns of Caloocan, Las Piñas, Mariquina, Pasig, Parañaque, Malabon, Navotas, San Juan del Monte, San Pedro de Macati, San Felipe Neri, Muntinlupa and the Taguig-Pateros area were designated to the province of Rizal, with Pasig being the provincial capital.

In 1939, President Quezon established Quezon City with the objective of replacing Manila as the capital city of the Philippines..A design for Quezon City was completed..The establishment of Quezon City meant the abandonment of Burnham's design for Manila, with funds being diverted for the establishment of the new capital.
After World War II, in 1945, President Sergio Osmeña signed Executive Order No..58, which dissolved the city of Greater Manila instituted by former President Quezon.
Japanese invasion and Second Philippine Republic
Creation of the city of Greater Manila
Main article: City of Greater Manila
Map of the City of Greater Manila that existed from 1942 to 1945
In 1942, during the World War II, President Manuel L. Quezon created the City of Greater Manila as an emergency measure, merging the cities of Manila and Quezon City, along with the municipalities of Caloocan, Makati, Mandaluyong, Parañaque, Pasay, and San Juan..Jorge Vargas was appointed as its first mayor..Mayors in the cities and municipalities included in the City of Greater Manila served as assistant mayors in their town..This was to ensure that Vargas, who was Quezon's principal lieutenant for administrative matters, would have a position of authority recognized under international military law..The City of Greater Manila served as a model for the present-day Metro Manila and the administrative functions of the Governor of Metro Manila that was established during the Marcos administration.
The City of Greater Manila was dissolved in 1945, when President Sergio Osmeña signed Executive Order No..58.
Third Philippine Republic
Creation of the National Capital Region
World War II resulted in the loss of more than 100,000 lives in the battle of Manila in 1945..Most of the developments in Burnham's design were also destroyed..Later on, Quezon City was eventually declared as the national capital in 1948.
Reinstitution as Metropolitan Manila under martial law
On November 7, 1975, Metro Manila was formally established through Presidential Decree No..824..The Metropolitan Manila Commission was also created to manage the region..When Metro Manila was established, there were four cities, Manila, Quezon City, Caloocan, Pasay and the thirteen municipalities of Las Piñas, Makati, Malabon, Mandaluyong, Marikina, Muntinlupa, Navotas, Parañaque, Pasig, Pateros, San Juan, Taguig, and Valenzuela..At present, all but one of these municipalities have become independent chartered cities; only Pateros still remains as a municipality.
President Ferdinand Marcos appointed his wife, First Lady Imelda Marcos, as the first governor of Metro Manila..She launched the City of Man campaign..The Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex, Metropolitan Folk Arts Theater, Philippine International Convention Center, Coconut Palace and healthcare facilities such as the Lung Center of the Philippines, Philippine Heart Center, and the Kidney Center of the Philippines are all constructed precisely for this purpose.
The capital of the Philippines was re-designated to Manila in 1976 through Presidential Decree No..940..The decree states that Manila has always been, to the Filipino people and in the eyes of the world, the premier city of the Philippines, being the center of trade, commerce, education, and culture..While the then-newly formed region was designated as the seat of government.
Fourth Philippine Republic
President Marcos was overthrown in a non-violent revolution along EDSA, which lasted four days in late February 1986..The popular uprising, now known as the People Power Revolution, made international headlines as ""the revolution that surprised the world"".
Fifth Philippine Republic
In 1986, President Corazon Aquino laid down the Executive Order No..392, reorganizing and changing the structure of the Metropolitan Manila Commission and renamed it to the Metropolitan Manila Authority..Mayors in the metropolis chose from among themselves the chair of the agency..Later on, it was again reorganized in 1995 through Republic Act No..7924, creating the present-day Metropolitan Manila Development Authority..The chairperson of the agency would be appointed by the President and should not have a concurrent elected position such as mayor..Elfren Cruz was the last to serve as the Officer-In-Charge governor of Metro Manila.
Throughout 1988, unemployment among the country's regions was highest in Metro Manila, with 20.1% of the region's workforce being jobless according to the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and the National Statistics Office.
In 2014, then-MMDA chairman Francis Tolentino proposed that San Pedro, Laguna be included in Metro Manila as its 18th member city..Tolentino said that in the first meeting of the MMDA Council of mayors in January 2015, he would push for the inclusion of the city to the MMDA.
In April 2022, Makati lost the territorial dispute with Taguig, which was ruled with finality a year later in April 2023..Ten barangays, including the Embo barangays, were thus transferred to Taguig.
Geography
See also: Geography of Manila and Land reclamation in Metro Manila
Metropolitan Manila, or the National Capital Region, is divided morphologically into three major parts..These are the: Central Plateau, Coastal Lowland, and Marikina Valley
Drainage map of the Pasig-Marikina River system
Metro Manila is located in the southwestern portion of Luzon..The region lies along the flat alluvial lands extending from the mouth of the Pasig River in the west to the higher rugged lands of Marikina Valley in the east..The region is geographically divided into 4 zones: the Coastal Margin, Guadalupe Plateau, Marikina Valley, and the Laguna Lowlands.
The Coastal Margin or Lowland is a flat and low plain that faces Manila Bay..Located here is Manila, Navotas, parts of Malabon, and the western part and reclaimed areas of Pasay and Parañaque, where the ground elevation ranges from zero meters on Manila Bay to five meters (16 ft) at the west side of the cities of Mandaluyong and Makati..The Coastal Lowland possesses resources for offshore fisheries and fishpond development, and various reclamation projects in the area are meant for mixed-use urban development.
The Central or Guadalupe Plateau is the most adaptable to urban development activities not only because of its solid geographical foundations but also because of its existing infrastructure links with the rest of Luzon..It is mainly residential and includes the densely populated areas of Metro Manila such San Juan, Makati and Quezon City, as well as most parts of Caloocan and Mandaluyong..The ground elevation ranges from 20 to 40 meters (66 to 131 ft) and gradually becomes lower towards its western side, while ground elevation ranges from 70 to 100 meters (230 to 330 ft) towards the northwestern side of the plateau..The area becomes narrower along the Pasig River.
The Marikina Valley is a floodplain along the Marikina River and a delta along Laguna de Bay..Its elevation ranges from two meters (6 ft 7 in) on the Laguna de Bay side to 30 meters (98 ft) on its north side towards Montalban..It is surrounded by the Central Plateau and mountains of Rizal..It has fertile land suitable for crop cultivation while the Marikina River provides water for industrial uses and discharge.
The Laguna Lowlands is not only suitable for agriculture and aquaculture but also for industrial activity.
Natural hazards
Flooding brought by Typhoon Ketsana (Tropical Storm Ondoy) in 2009 caused 484 deaths in Metro Manila alone.
Metro Manila is exposed to multiple natural hazards such as earthquakes, floods, and typhoons..It is surrounded by active faults including the Marikina Valley Fault System..Other distant faults such as the Philippine Faults, Lubang Faults, Manila Trench and Casiguran Faults, are a threat as well.
Climate
According to the Köppen climate classification, there are two climates in Metro Manila..Most of the region has a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen climate classification Aw) while the northeastern part of the region that lies on the foothills of Sierra Madre has a tropical monsoon climate..Together with the rest of the Philippines, Manila lies entirely within the tropics..Its proximity to the equator means that temperatures are hot year-round, rarely going below 15 °C or above 39 °C..Temperature extremes have ranged from 14.4 °C on January 11, 1914,
Humidity levels are usually very high all year round..Manila has a distinct dry season from December through April, and a relatively lengthy wet season that covers the remaining period with slightly cooler temperatures..In the wet season, it rarely rains all day, but rainfall is very heavy during short periods..Typhoons usually occur from June to September.

Paco Park is a former municipal cemetery built by the Dominicans during the Spanish colonial times.
There are four national parks in Metro Manila..These are the Rizal Park, Paco Park, and Fort Santiago in the City of Manila and Quezon Memorial National Park in Quezon City..Rizal Park and Paco Park are managed by the National Parks and Development Committee (NPDC), while Fort Santiago is managed by the Intramuros Administration..A tripartite agreement between the Quezon City Government, the National Historical Institute and the NPDC transferred the management of Quezon Memorial National Park to the Quezon City Government.
Rizal Park, also known as Luneta Park, is considered the largest urban park in Asia with an area of 58 hectares (140 acres)..Filipino Landscape architect IP Santos, the ""Father of Philippine Landscape Architecture"", was commissioned to do the design of converting the former cemetery into a park.
Manila Zoo is the oldest zoo in Asia, which was founded in 1959..It is the home to more than a thousand animals from 90 different species including the 40-year-old elephant, Mali..The zoo has an average of 4,000 visitors weekly..An estimated 40,000 tourists visit the zoo each month.
La Mesa Ecopark is a 33-hectare well-developed sanctuary around the La Mesa Watershed..It was established through a joint partnership between the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System, ABS-CBN, and the Quezon City Government..La Mesa Ecopark, along with the Ninoy Aquino Parks & Wildlife Center, are important nature reserves in the Philippines.
The Las Piñas-Parañaque Critical Habitat and Ecotourism Area (LPPCHEA) was declared as a critical habitat by the Government of the Philippines in 2007

The framework of government and governance in Metro Manila is based on Republic Act No..7160, otherwise known as the ""Local Government Code of 1991""..This law outlines the powers and responsibilities of all local government units (LGUS) in the Philippines and thus forms the basis of inter-local governmental relations among the area's constituent local governments..The local government code grants these units significant political and administrative autonomy in accordance with the principles of decentralization and devolution of power..This situation presents a challenge to the coordination of policy and service delivery across the multiple autonomous local government units and is thus the underlying dilemma of metropolitan governance in Metro Manila.
The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) is the agency responsible for the delivery of public services in Metro Manila..Its services are limited to traffic management and garbage collection..Previously Metro Manila was governed by a regional government authority, the Metro Manila Commission and was led by a governor.
A bill was introduced in 2014 proposing the creation of a new governing body in Metro Manila to be known as the Metropolitan Manila Regional Administration (MMRA)..Unlike the MMDA which is limited to being an administrative coordinating body, the proposed MMRA will have police and other typical municipal powers and is more akin to the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.
Metro Manila, the National Capital Region, is the seat of the national government..All the main offices of the executive departments of the country are in Metro Manila..The Department of Agrarian Reform, Department of Agriculture, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, National Housing Authority and Philippine Coconut Authority has their main offices based around Quezon Memorial Circle in Quezon City.
Manila, the capital city of the country, is the home to Malacañan Palace, the official residence and office of the President of the Philippines..The city is also the home to the Supreme Court of the Philippines..Other key national institutions based in Manila are the Court of Appeals, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, and the Departments of Budget and Management, Finance, Health, Justice, Labor and Employment and Public Works and Highways..Meanwhile, the Department of Science and Technology is based in Taguig while the Department of Tourism has its headquarters in Makati..Important economic and financial institutions headquartered in the region are the Asian Development Bank, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Development Bank of the Philippines, Land Bank of the Philippines and the National Economic and Development Authority.
The main office of the Government Service Insurance System in Pasay serves as home to the Senate of the Philippines..Meanwhile, the House of Representatives of the Philippines is based in the Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City along with the Sandiganbayan..The Coconut Palace once served as the official office and residence of the Vice President of the Philippines in 2010–2016 and then the Quezon City Reception House for 2016-2022.
Administrative divisions
The political and administrative boundaries of the National Capital Region has not changed since its formation in 1975 as a public corporation under Presidential Decree No..824..They are composed of sixteen independent cities, classified as highly urbanized cities, and one independent municipality: Pateros.

The Smokey Mountain Development and Reclamation Project for the former Smokey Mountain dumpsite and slum community is a prime example of in-city relocation housing for informal settler families in Tondo, City of Manila.
From the 1980s up to the present, informal settlers have accounted for roughly one-third of the Metro Manila population.
During the American occupation, housing policies in Manila dealt the problem of sanitation and concentration of settlers around business areas..Among those implemented were business codes and sanitation laws in slum areas in the 1930s..During this period and until the 1950s, new communities were opened for relocation..Among these were Projects 1–8 in Diliman, Quezon City and the Vitas tenement houses in Tondo..The government implemented the Public Housing Policy in 1947 that established the People's Homesite and Housing Corporation (PHHC)..A few years later, it put up the Slum Clearance Committee which, with the help of the PHHC, relocated thousands of families from Tondo and Quezon City to Sapang Palay in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan in the 1960s.
During the time of President Ferdinand Marcos, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank supported the programs for the ""development of relocation"" and ""on-site development."".Carmona and Dasmariñas in Cavite and San Pedro in Laguna opened as relocation sites..Along with the establishment of the National Housing Authority (Philippines), Presidential Decree 772 made squatting a crime, making the Philippines one of only two countries (the other is South Africa) where squatting is a crime..The government formulated the National Shelter Program which became the over-all framework for dealing with housing needs of all income classes.
Imelda Marcos held both the position as Governor of Metro Manila and as Minister of Human Settlements and Ecology (MHSE) until the downfall of the dictatorship in 1986..The MHSE, through loans from the World Bank, initiated the Bagong Lipunan Improvement of Sites and Services (BLISS) housing projects not only in Metro Manila but also in other provinces.
From 1960 to 1992, the government transferred some 328,000 families to resettlement sites 25 to 40 km (16 to 25 mi) from Metro Manila..According to the Asian Coalition on Housing Rights, during President Corazon C. Aquino's time, the government would bring some 100,000 persons to relocation sites yearly..During the said period, Sapang Palay and Carmona had a 60% abandonment rate..Congress enacted Republic Act No..7279 or the Urban Development and Housing Act (UDHA) in 1992..The law gave a new name for the squatters: informal settlers.
In the middle of the presidency of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, infrastructure projects of the government led to the demolition of hundreds of thousands of families (from along railways, C-4 Road, C-5 Road, and from Fort Bonifacio)..During the same period, new relocation sites in Bulacan, Valenzuela and Caloocan opened.
Languages

The National Capital Region accounts for 31.1% of the gross domestic product of the Philippines in 2023.
Metro Manila would add 1.85 million square meters (7.1×10−7×10^6 sq mi) of office spaces between 2015 and 2017 in the central business districts in Makati, Taguig, and Quezon City as more global firms such as Google and HSBC seek to outsource business processes in the Philippines.
Metro Manila makes it to the ""Global Top 30"" cities according to property consultancy firm Jones Lang LaSalle, citing its economic scale, vast population, large gross domestic product and BPO specialization as its competitive edge.
Binondo, founded in 1594, is considered as the oldest chinatown in the world.
Historically, the main business district of the metropolis was Binondo, where commercial trading flourished since the 15th century..By the 1960s, economic activities shifted from Binondo to Makati..It transformed Makati into one of the leading financial centers in Asia..Still, Binondo remained as a cultural and financial center because of the vast Chinese population residing and doing business in the area.
The minimum wage of Metro Manila is at ₱610.00 {$10.91) per-day for non-agricultural workers and at ₱573 ($10.25) per-day for those working in the agricultural sector,
Nominal wages are what Metro Manila's current minimum wage rates are known as..The Philippine government has set these wage rates at a fixed amount.
On the other hand, the amount after inflation is what is considered the real minimum wage..For instance, the non-agricultural employees of NCR typically receive ₱428.23 per day as opposed to ₱537..The minimum salary for agricultural employees in Manila (including plantation and non-plantation workers) is 398.72 pesos after accounting for inflation.

Main article: List of roads in Metro Manila

The roads of Metro Manila are built around the City of Manila..Roads are classified as local, national or subdivision roads..There are ten radial roads branching out from the city..Also there are five circumferential roads forming a series of concentric semi-circular arcs around Manila..The circumferential and radial roads are systems of interconnected roads, bridges and highways..A problem with the circumferential roads are the missing road links..These are the roads that are not yet constructed to give way for development due to Metro Manila's rapid urbanization..The metropolis is resolving this problem through the completion of missing road links or through the construction of connector roads.
The radial and circumferential road system are being supplanted by a new numbered highway system implemented by the Department of Public Works and Highways, and new signage are being placed with its implementation..Expressways are being assigned numbers with the E prefix..National roads are assigned 1 to 3 digit numbers, except for those classified as tertiary national roads.
An important circumferential road is the Circumferential Road 4, with the Epifanio de los Santos Avenue as its major component..It traverses the cities of Pasay, Makati, Mandaluyong, Quezon City and Caloocan..Line 3 follows the alignment of EDSA, from Taft Avenue in Pasay up to TriNoma, terminating before it reaches Caloocan..Circumferential Road 5 serves the people near the regional limits of Metro Manila and also serves as an alternate route for Circumferential Road 4.
Prominent radial roads include the Radial Road 1, composed of Roxas Boulevard and the Manila–Cavite Expressway (Coastal Road) that connects Metro Manila to Cavite, Radial Road 3 or the South Luzon Expressway that connects Metro Manila to Laguna, Radial Road 6, composed of Aurora Boulevard and Marcos Highway that runs up to Rizal and Radial Road 8 or the North Luzon Expressway that serves as the gateway to the north.
The Skyway serves as the region's main expressway, directly connecting the North Luzon Expressway and the South Luzon Expressway..It also enables access to Ninoy Aquino International Airport via the NAIA Expressway (NAIAX)..The Skyway is the first fully grade-separated highway in the Philippines and one of the longest elevated highways in the world with a total length of approximately 42.79 kilometers (26.59 mi)..Other expressways such as the Manila–Cavite Expressway and Muntinlupa–Cavite Expressway also connect Metro Manila to its surrounding areas.
The development of roads, highways and expressways are based on the Metro Manila Dream Plan..Ongoing projects in the dream plan include the rehabilitation of EDSA, C-5 Southlink Expressway, NLEX Connector, and the construction of the missing road links for the circumferential roads (e.g..Taft Avenue Flyover, Metro Manila Interchange Project Phase IV).
Railway systems
Main article: Rail transportation in the Greater Manila Area
Various railway systems in Metro Manila; from top left to right: LRT Line 1, LRT Line 2, MRT Line 3, and PNR Metro Commuter.
System map of the Metro Manila railway system.Rail transportation in the Greater Manila Area is a major part of the transportation system in Metro Manila and its surrounding areas..It consists of the Manila Light Rail Transit System, Manila Metro Rail Transit System, and the PNR Metro Commuter Line..As of 2021, the three systems and its four operational lines combined has 82 stations, covering a total of 113.3 km (70.4 mi)..The network makes up the majority of active railways in the country and bear the brunt of providing the metropolis with rail as a faster alternative mode of transport other than buses and jeepneys..However, these systems are currently insufficient for the rapidly expanding metropolis; to address this, new lines and line extensions are under construction, which will extend the system far out into neighboring regions.
Several new railway projects are being undertaken by the national government and the private sector..These include the North–South Commuter Railway, the Metro Manila Subway, and MRT Line 7, all of which are under construction.
Air
Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) is the only airport and the premier gateway in Metro Manila..It is the busiest airport in the Philippines..NAIA has four terminals: Terminal 1, Terminal 2 (which is exclusively used by Philippine Airlines), Terminal 3 (the newest and largest airport terminal in NAIA) and Terminal 4 (also known as the Manila Domestic passenger Terminal)..The other airport that serves Metro Manila is Clark International Airport in Angeles City which is located 80 kilometers (50 mi) away.
Buses

Bus franchises in the region are regulated by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board..The Premium Point-to-Point Bus Service is the express bus system that runs from its dispatch terminal in Fairview up to the central business districts along EDSA..It aims to cut travel time substantially and provide a faster, safer and more convenient bus service to commuters, who are usually caught at the heavy traffic across the metropolis..A second express bus link from SM North EDSA, Trinoma and SM Megamall to Makati opened in December 2015, and by January 2016 was the line on which, for the first time in nearly three decades, a double-decker bus traveled on EDSA, to the delight of motorists, followed by a third link, this time from Robinsons Galleria to the Ayala Center complex in February 2016 and a fourth in March linking the Ayala Center to the Alabang Town Center in Muntinlupa via the Metro Manila Skyway (and later to Ayala Malls South Park)..As of the present express buses also link the Market Market mall and Circuit Makati to both the Nuvali residential township and the Pacita Village complex in San Pedro, both in Laguna, in services launched in 2014 and 2017, respectively (plus additional services to the UP Town Mall in Quezon City and SM Masinag in Antipolo, Rizal), while intercity express buses have been in operation since 2015 to alleviate traffic on EDSA..In 2018, additional services from the Makati CBD and from San Lorenzo Place up to Cavite debuted.
Metro Manila will have its bus rapid transit system operational by 2018..The 27.7 kilometers (17.2 mi) proposed BRT system will traverse Commonwealth Avenue up to the Manila City Hall..The planned BRT system costs ₱4.9 billion ($109.5 million) and will have a fleet of 300 buses and 32 stations.
Ferry
Main article: Pasig River Ferry Service
The Pasig River Ferry Service run by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority is the principal ferry shuttle system of Metro Manila..It traverses the Pasig River from Barangay Pinagbuhatan in Pasig to Plaza Mexico in Intramuros..Although it was referred to as a ferry, it is more akin to a water bus..It has 17 stations, but only 14 are operational..Another ferry route called the Manila-Bataan Ferry was launched on May 10, 2017, and traverses Manila Bay from the Bay Terminal at CCP Complex in Manila to Orion, Bataan..A new ferry route known as the Cavite-Manila Ferry Service that runs between Noveleta, Cavite and Intramuros was launched in January 2018.

The Maynilad Water Services took over the west zone, which is composed of Manila (excluding the southeastern part of the city), Caloocan, Las Piñas, Malabon, Muntinlupa, Navotas, Parañaque, Pasay and Valenzuela..It also operates in some parts of Makati and Quezon City..Manila Water operates on the east zone, comprising the cities of Mandaluyong, Marikina, Pasig, Pateros, San Juan and Taguig..It also operates in large areas of Makati and Quezon City and the southeastern part of Manila, which was excluded from the west zone.
For garbage hauling, the region spent ₱4.221 billion ($93.855 million) in 2013..Quezon City spent the most at ₱994.59 million ($22.115 million) while Pateros, the region's only municipality, spent the least money on garbage at ₱9.478 million ($210,747).
